10110 DATA 2,1,"In Section IV (Research Recommendations) we present a general"

10266 DATA 2,1,"The conceptual framework we seek must orient us toward the real"

10271 DATA 2,6,"individuals achieve their present level of effectiveness, and"
10272 DATA 2,7,"expect that this examination will reveal possibilities for"
10273 DATA 2,8,"improvement."
10274 DATA 1,12,"2a2","032","","",4
10275 DATA 2,1,"The entire effect of an individual on the world stems"
10276 DATA 2,2,"essentially from what he can transmit to the world through his"
10277 DATA 2,3,"limited motor channels. This in turn is based on information"
10278 DATA 2,4,"received from the outside world through limited sensory"
10279 DATA 2,5,"channels; on information, drives, and needs generated within"
10280 DATA 2,6,"him; and on his processing of that information. His processing"
10281 DATA 2,7,"is of two kinds: that which he is generally conscious of"
10282 DATA 2,8,"(recognizing patterns, remembering, visualizing, abstracting,"
10283 DATA 2,9,"deducing, inducing, etc.), and that involving the unconscious"
10284 DATA 2,10,"processing and mediating of received and self-generated"

10289 DATA 2,2,"to grapple directly with the sort of complex situation in which"
10290 DATA 2,3,"we seek to give him help. He uses his innate capabilities in a"
10291 DATA 2,4,"rather more indirect fashion, since the situation is generally"
10292 DATA 2,5,"too complex to yield directly to his motor actions, and always"
10293 DATA 2,6,"too complex to yield comprehensions and solutions from direct"

14044 DATA 2,8,"processes--which includes, of course,   the possible inclusion"

14047 DATA 2,11,"sophistication of the sub-processes which can be"
14048 DATA 2,12,"<i>specified</i> for the human to do. Some of these"
14049 DATA 2,13,"specifications have to be given in a language which matches the"
14050 DATA 2,14,"human's rich working framework of concepts--and we have been"

14067 DATA 2,10,"this.  With the human contributing to a process, we   find more"
14068 DATA 2,11,"and more as the process becomes complex that the   value of the"
14069 DATA 2,12,"human's contribution depends upon how much   freedom he is given"
14070 DATA 2,13,"to be disorderly in his course of action.   For instance, we"
14071 DATA 2,14,"provide him as much help as possible in   making a plan of"
14072 DATA 2,15,"action. Then we give him as much help as we   can in carrying it"
14073 DATA 2,16,"out.  But we also have to allow him to   change his mind at"
14074 DATA 2,17,"almost any point, and to want to modify his   plans. So, we"
14075 DATA 2,18,"provide augmentation help to him for keeping   track of his"
14076 DATA 2,19,"plans where he is in them, what has been   happening in carrying"
14077 DATA 2,20,"them out to date--and for evaluating   possibilities that might"
14078 DATA 2,21,"occur to him for changing the   plans. In fact, we are even"
14079 DATA 2,22,"learning how the computer can be   made to watch for some kinds"

14083 DATA 2,1,"&quot;Here's a simple example of this sort   of help for the"
14084 DATA 2,2,"human. Last winter, we designed a computer   process that can"
14085 DATA 2,3,"automatically monitor the occurrence of   specified types of"
14086 DATA 2,4,"computer usage over a specified period of   time, and which,"
14087 DATA 2,5,"from the resulting data, can deduce a   surprising amount of"
14088 DATA 2,6,"information regarding how the human made   use of that time."
14089 DATA 2,7,"This was quite helpful to us for evaluating   our ways of doing"
14090 DATA 2,8,"things. Then we added more features to the   program, in which"
14091 DATA 2,9,"the computer occasionally interrupts the   human's activity and"
14092 DATA 2,10,"displays some questions to be   answered. From these answers,"
14093 DATA 2,11,"together with its normal   monitoring data, the program can"
14094 DATA 2,12,"provide evaluative data   regarding the relative success of his"

14096 DATA 2,14,"intrigued by this angle   and bore down a little on it. They"

14119 DATA 2,8,"developing these structures have   evolved to facilitate their"
14120 DATA 2,9,"later modification. For instance,   every basic consideration"

14132 DATA 2,1,"&quot;Maybe an example will help   here. There is a plan I am"

14138 DATA 2,7,"for reviewing process   structures--and symbol-structures, too,"
14139 DATA 2,8,"for that   matter. Recently, I got an idea as to how I might add"

14148 DATA 1,11,"3b8u","0351","","",5
14149 DATA 2,1,"&quot;This I could do relatively rapidly,   by your standards,"
14150 DATA 2,2,"by snooping down the antecedent trails,   looking for statements"

14154 DATA 2,6,"where I've marked things as yes, or no, or   possible, and does"
14155 DATA 2,7,"the bookkeeping and calculating necessary   to guide me through"

14490 DATA 2,2,"advanced concepts and techniques that have   evolved here,"
14491 DATA 2,3,"compatible with, but beyond, what I have so far   shown you. And"

14493 DATA 2,5,"appreciation for the potential worth of   possibilities to be"
14494 DATA 2,6,"developed had to evolve too, and only came   with the experience"
14495 DATA 2,7,"and perspective gained in our earlier   work."
14496 DATA 1,12,"3b10e","0376","","",5
14497 DATA 2,1,"&quot;For instance, we initially felt   that defining categories"
14498 DATA 2,2,"and relationships, and making a plan   for action, were things"
14499 DATA 2,3,"to be done as quickly as possible so   that we could get on with"
14500 DATA 2,4,"the work. But, as our means   developed for dealing with"

14504 DATA 2,8,"capability for complex   bookkeeping relative to our interlaced"
14505 DATA 2,9,"hierarchies of   objectives, plans, and arguments, we found that"
14506 DATA 2,10,"defining a new   cate gory, searching for members or instances"
14507 DATA 2,11,"of it, or   applying its selection criteria were becoming ever"

14509 DATA 1,16,"3b10f","0377","","",5

14512 DATA 2,3,"different types of arguments, different   types of"
14513 DATA 2,4,"relationships, and different types of descriptions.   For a"
14514 DATA 2,5,"specific example, Ranganathan<a"

14518 DATA 2,9,"and named how one term could relate to the other as either"
14519 DATA 2,10,"biasing it, being a tool used to study it, being an aspect of"
14520 DATA 2,11,"it, being in comparison with it, or influencing it. Vickery"
14521 DATA 2,12,"gave more examples, saying one could also have an effect on"
14522 DATA 2,13,"the other, be a cause of it, be a use for it, be a substitute"
14523 DATA 2,14,"for it, a source for it, an implication of it, be an"
14524 DATA 2,15,"explanation of it, or be a representation of it. There are"
14525 DATA 2,16,"even more categories mentioned in the literature."
14526 DATA 1,10,"3b10g","0378","","",5
14527 DATA 2,1,"&quot;It was easy to form tags and links,   and we experimented"

14532 DATA 2,6,"structures, to be sure, but we found on the one   hand that the"

14534 DATA 2,8,"on the other hand that we could get   considerably more"

14537 DATA 1,17,"3b10h","0379","","",5
14538 DATA 2,1,"&quot;We began to work up processes that   would help us"

14541 DATA 2,4,"something fit a given category or   not, search for all possible"
14542 DATA 2,5,"members of it within a given   substructure, and so forth.  The"
14543 DATA 2,6,"very fact of using this   careful classifi cation within our"
14544 DATA 2,7,"structures allowed us to   get more powerful help from the"
14545 DATA 2,8,"computer in these   classification processes. I should mention"
14546 DATA 2,9,"that the   relationships among the terms in a sentence--the"
14547 DATA 2,10,"syntax if you   wish--had been given further specification tags"
14548 DATA 2,11,"than those I   showed you earlier, to remove ambiguities that"
14549 DATA 2,12,"hindered the   computer from going back to a statement and"
14550 DATA 2,13,"resolving the   syntactical structure. Also, ambiguities in the"
14551 DATA 2,14,"meaning of the   terms began to limit us, and we developed"
14552 DATA 2,15,"methods for removing   a good deal of this semantic ambiguity."
14553 DATA 2,16,"This slowed us down,   as I've mentioned, but not as much as"

14555 DATA 1,14,"3b10i","0380","","",5
14556 DATA 2,1,"&quot;Let me demonstrate one of the   advanced processes which"
14557 DATA 2,2,"has evolved.  It is heavily dependent   upon the very care in"
14558 DATA 2,3,"building structures that it so nicely   facilitates, and also"
14559 DATA 2,4,"upon several other developments. One of   these other"
14560 DATA 2,5,"developments stems from the concepts and   techniques of the"
14561 DATA 2,6,"semantic differential, as first introduced   by Osgood, Suci,"
14562 DATA 2,7,"and Tannenbaum <a href=&quot;#Notes-3-2&quot;>2</a> back in"

14564 DATA 2,9,"href=&quot;#Notes-3-3&quot;>3</a> on what they called semantic"
14565 DATA 2,10,"models. These offered useful possibilities for establishing"
14566 DATA 2,11,"quite precisely what meaning a concept has to an individual,"
14567 DATA 2,12,"relative to his general conceptual framework, and for"
14568 DATA 2,13,"representing this meaning in a specific way that was amenable"

14570 DATA 1,14,"3b10j","0381","","",5
14571 DATA 2,1,"&quot;The other development upon which   this process to be"

14573 DATA 2,3,"flexible cooperation with the computer was   calling for lots of"
14574 DATA 2,4,"little interactions. Our working   repertoire of small-task"
14575 DATA 2,5,"requests for computer service was   getting quite large, and it"
14576 DATA 2,6,"was proving to be extremely   valuable to use them and to be"
14577 DATA 2,7,"able to remember automatically   their procedures and"
14578 DATA 2,8,"designation codes. One of our research   psychologists had"
14579 DATA 2,9,"worked on human-memory phenomena before he   came with us, and"
14580 DATA 2,10,"had interested himself in mnemonic aids of   all sorts. He has"
14581 DATA 2,11,"developed some useful techniques for us to   use in connection"
14582 DATA 2,12,"with this, and other problems. Now let me   demonstrate this"
14583 DATA 2,13,"example of an advanced process for helping   work with"

14837 DATA 2,5,"recommend the particular task of computer programming for this"
14838 DATA 2,6,"purpose--with many reasons behind the selection that should come"
14839 DATA 2,7,"out in the following discussion. Some of the more direct reasons"
14840 DATA 2,8,"are these:"
14841 DATA 1,3,"4c1a","0405","","",5
14842 DATA 2,1,"1. The programmer works on many problems, including large and"
14843 DATA 2,2,"realistic ones, which can be solved without interaction with"

14845 DATA 1,4,"4c1b","0406","","",5
14846 DATA 2,1,"2. Typical and realistic problems for the programmer to solve"

14848 DATA 2,3,"amounts of working and reference in formation. This also eases"
14849 DATA 2,4,"the experimental problem."
14850 DATA 1,7,"4c1c","0407","","",5
14851 DATA 2,1,"3. Much of the programmer's working data are computer programs"
14852 DATA 2,2,"(he also has, we assume, his own reasoning and planning notes),"
14853 DATA 2,3,"which have unambiguous syntactic and semantic form so that"
14854 DATA 2,4,"getting the computer to do useful tasks for him on his working"

14858 DATA 1,5,"4c1d","0408","","",5
14859 DATA 2,1,"4. A programmer's effectiveness, relative to other programmers,"

15229 DATA 2,3,"done: (1) An hypothesis has been presented. (2) A conceptual"
15230 DATA 2,4,"framework has been constructed. (3) A &quot;picture&quot; of"
15231 DATA 2,5,"augmented man has been described. (4) A research approach has"
15232 DATA 2,6,"been outlined. These aspects will be re viewed here briefly:"
15233 DATA 1,4,"5a1","0448","","",4
15234 DATA 2,1,"1. An hypothesis has been stated that the intellectual"
15235 DATA 2,2,"effectiveness of a human can be significantly improved by an"
15236 DATA 2,3,"engineering-like approach toward redesigning changeable"
15237 DATA 2,4,"components of a system."
15238 DATA 1,6,"5a2","0449","","",4
15239 DATA 2,1,"2. A conceptual framework has been constructed that helps"
15240 DATA 2,2,"provide a way of looking at the implications and possibilities"
15241 DATA 2,3,"surrounding and stemming from this hypothesis. Briefly, this"
15242 DATA 2,4,"framework provides the realization that our intellects are"
15243 DATA 2,5,"already augmented by means which appear to have the following"
15244 DATA 2,6,"characteristics:"
15245 DATA 1,2,"5a2a","0450","","",5
15246 DATA 2,1,"A. The principal elements are the language artifacts, and"
15247 DATA 2,2,"methodology that a human has learned to use."
15248 DATA 1,2,"5a2b","0451","","",5
15249 DATA 2,1,"B. The elements are dynamically interdependent within an"
15250 DATA 2,2,"operating system."
15251 DATA 1,5,"5a2c","0452","","",5
15252 DATA 2,1,"C. The structure of the system seems to be hierarchical, and to"
15253 DATA 2,2,"be best considered as a hierarchy of process capabilities whose"
15254 DATA 2,3,"primitive components are the basic human capabilities and the"
15255 DATA 2,4,"functional capabilities of the artifacts--which are organized"
15256 DATA 2,5,"successively into ever-more-sophisticated capabilities."
15257 DATA 1,4,"5a2d","0453","","",5
15258 DATA 2,1,"D. The capabilities of prime interest are those associated with"
15259 DATA 2,2,"manipulating symbols and concepts in support of organizing and"
15260 DATA 2,3,"executing processes from which are ultimately derived human"
15261 DATA 2,4,"comprehension and problem solutions."
15262 DATA 1,3,"5a2e","0454","","",5
15263 DATA 2,1,"E. The automation of the symbol manipulation associated with the"
15264 DATA 2,2,"minute-by-minute mental processes seems to offer a logical next"
15265 DATA 2,3,"step in the evolution of our intellectual capability."
15266 DATA 1,7,"5a3","0455","","",4
15267 DATA 2,1,"3. A picture of the implications and promise of this framework"
15268 DATA 2,2,"has been described, based upon direct human communication with a"
15269 DATA 2,3,"computer. Here the many ways in which the computer could be of"
15270 DATA 2,4,"service, at successive levels of augmented capability, have been"
15271 DATA 2,5,"brought out. This picture is fanciful, but we believe it to be"
15272 DATA 2,6,"conservative and representative of the sort of rich and"
15273 DATA 2,7,"significant gains that are there to be pursued."
15274 DATA 1,24,"5a4","0456","","",4
15275 DATA 2,1,"4. An approach has been outlined for testing the hypothesis of"
15276 DATA 2,2,"Item (1) and for pursuing the &quot;rich and significant"
15277 DATA 2,3,"gains&quot; which we feel are promised. This approach is"
15278 DATA 2,4,"designed to treat the redesign of a capability hierarchy by"
15279 DATA 2,5,"reworking from the bottom up, and yet to make the research on"
15280 DATA 2,6,"augmentation means progress as fast as possible by deriving"
15281 DATA 2,7,"practically usable augmentation systems for real-world problem"
15282 DATA 2,8,"solvers at a maximum rate. This goal is fostered by the"
15283 DATA 2,9,"recommendation of incorporating positive feedback into the"
15284 DATA 2,10,"research development--i.e., concentrating a good share of the"
15285 DATA 2,11,"basic-research attention upon augmenting those capabilities in a"
15286 DATA 2,12,"human that are needed in the augmentation-research workers. The"
15287 DATA 2,13,"real-world applications would be pursued by designing a"
15288 DATA 2,14,"succession of systems for specialists, whose progression"
15289 DATA 2,15,"corresponds to the increasing generality of the capabilities for"
15290 DATA 2,16,"which coordinated augmentation means have been evolved."
15291 DATA 2,17,"Consideration is given in this rather global approach to"
15292 DATA 2,18,"providing potential users in different domains of intellectual"
15293 DATA 2,19,"activity with the basic general-purpose augmentation system from"
15294 DATA 2,20,"which they themselves can construct the special featuresof a"
15295 DATA 2,21,"system to match their job, and their ways of working--or it"
15296 DATA 2,22,"could be used on the other hand by researchers who want to"
15297 DATA 2,23,"pursue the development of sepcial augmentation systems for"
15298 DATA 2,24,"special fields."

15300 DATA 2,1,"VI. CONCLUSIONS"
15301 DATA 1,3,"6a","0458","","",3
15302 DATA 2,1,"Three principal conclusions may be drawn concerning the"
15303 DATA 2,2,"significance and implications of the ideas that have been"
15304 DATA 2,3,"presented."
15305 DATA 1,10,"6b","0459","","",3
15306 DATA 2,1,"First any possibility for improving the effective utilization of"
15307 DATA 2,2,"the intellectual power of society's problem solvers warrants the"
15308 DATA 2,3,"most serious consideration. This is because man's problem-"
15309 DATA 2,4,"solving capability represents possibly the most important"
15310 DATA 2,5,"resource possessed by a society. The other contenders for first"
15311 DATA 2,6,"importance are all critically dependent for their development"
15312 DATA 2,7,"and use upon this resource. Any possibility for evolving an art"
15313 DATA 2,8,"or science that can couple directly and significantly to the"
15314 DATA 2,9,"continued development of that resource should warrant doubly"
15315 DATA 2,10,"serious consideration."
15316 DATA 1,16,"6c","0460","","",3
15317 DATA 2,1,"Second, the ideas presented are to be considered in both of the"
15318 DATA 2,2,"above senses: the direct-development sense and the 'art of"
15319 DATA 2,3,"development' sense.  To be sure, the possibilities have long-"
15320 DATA 2,4,"term implications, but their pursuit and initial rewards await"
15321 DATA 2,5,"us now. By our view, we <i>do not</i> have to wait until we"
15322 DATA 2,6,"learn how the human mental processes work, we <i>do not</i> have"
15323 DATA 2,7,"to wait until we learn how to make computers more intelligent or"
15324 DATA 2,8,"bigger or faster, <i>we can</i> begin developing powerful and"
15325 DATA 2,9,"economically feasible augmentation systems on the basis of what"
15326 DATA 2,10,"we now know and have. Pursuit of further basic knowledge and"
15327 DATA 2,11,"improved machines will continue into the unlimited future, and"
15328 DATA 2,12,"will want to be integrated into the &quot;art&quot; and its"
15329 DATA 2,13,"improved augmentation systems--but getting started now will"
15330 DATA 2,14,"provide not only orientation and stimulation for these pursuits,"
15331 DATA 2,15,"but will give us improved problem-solving effectiveness with"
15332 DATA 2,16,"which to carry out the pursuits."
15333 DATA 1,9,"6d","0461","","",3
15334 DATA 2,1,"Third, it becomes increasingly clear that there should be action"
15335 DATA 2,2,"now--the sooner the better--action in a number of research"
15336 DATA 2,3,"communities and on an aggressive scale. We offer a conceptual"
15337 DATA 2,4,"framework and a plan for action, and we recommend that these be"
15338 DATA 2,5,"considered carefully as a basis for action If they be considered"
15339 DATA 2,6,"but found unacceptable, then at least serious and continued"
15340 DATA 2,7,"effort should be made toward developing a more acceptable"
15341 DATA 2,8,"conceptual framework within which to view the over-all approach,"
15342 DATA 2,9,"toward developing a more acceptable plan of action, or both."
15343 DATA 1,15,"6e","0462","","",3
15344 DATA 2,1,"This is an open plea to researchers and to those who ultimately"
15345 DATA 2,2,"motivate, finance, or direct them, to turn serious attention"
15346 DATA 2,3,"toward the possibility of evolving a dynamic discipline that"
15347 DATA 2,4,"can-treat the problem of improving intellectual effectiveness in"
15348 DATA 2,5,"a total sense. This discipline should aim at producing a"
15349 DATA 2,6,"continuous cycle of improvements--increased understanding of the"
15350 DATA 2,7,"problem, improved means for developing new aug mentation"
15351 DATA 2,8,"systems, and improved augmentation systems that can serve the"
15352 DATA 2,9,"world's problem solvers in general and this discipline's workers"
15353 DATA 2,10,"in particular. After all, we spend great sums for disciplines"
15354 DATA 2,11,"aimed at understanding and harnessing nuclear power. Why not"
15355 DATA 2,12,"consider developing a discipline aimed at understanding and"
15356 DATA 2,13,"harnessing &quot;neural power?&quot; In the long run, the power"
15357 DATA 2,14,"of the human intellect is really much the more important of the"
15358 DATA 2,15,"two."
