"1.1","1","INTRODUCTION"
"1.1.1","1","Large-scale challenges are best served if there are"
"1.1.1","2","appropriately scaled strategic principles to guide their"
"1.1.1","3","pursuit.  And special value results if the launch plan of a"
"1.1.1","4","long-term and large-scale strategy produces significant payoff"
"1.1.1","5","accrual early in the pursuit."
"1.1.2","1","We are addressing the large-scale, pervasive challenge of"
"1.1.2","2","improving the collective development and application of"
"1.1.2","3","knowledge.  Many years of focussed experience and conceptual"
"1.1.2","4","development underly the strategic framework guiding this"
"1.1.2","5","proposal."
"1.2","1","Phase-1, OHS Launch Project: HyperScope enhancement of Legacy"
"1.2","2","Systems:"
"1.2.1","1","Special Note:  Implementation of the HyperScope and all of the"
"1.2.1","2","later stages of the OHS are committed to being done as Open-"
"1.2.1","3","Source development.  There are clear and compelling reasons for"
"1.2.1","4","this, stemming from the scale and rate of evolution which needs"
"1.2.1","5","be accommodated, and from the number of collaborative"
"1.2.1","6","communities which need to be involved, PRO-ACTIVELY."
"1.2.2","1","The HyperScope will be a lightly modified web browser supported"
"1.2.2","2","by an &quot;Intermediary Processor&quot; (IP) which operates"
"1.2.2","3","between the browser and the files or data bases holding existing"
"1.2.2","4","working knowledge of a collaborative community.  The HyperScope"
"1.2.2","5","is not an editor."
"1.2.2.1","1","A Hyperscope user will be able to follow links into and between"
"1.2.2.1","2","these &quot;legacy&quot; files in a manner similar to using a"
"1.2.2.1","3","browser with web-based HTML files.  And more, there will be"
"1.2.2.1","4","numerous new capabilities and features which will give a"
"1.2.2.1","5","HyperScope user considerable more flexibility and working power"
"1.2.2.1","6","than users limited to standard browsers and &quot;legacy&quot;"
"1.2.2.1","7","editors."
"1.2.3","1","Brief Functional Description of Phase-1 HyperScope -- new"
"1.2.3","2","capabilities provided to HyperScope users operating within"
"1.2.3","3","legacy environments:"
"1.2.3.1","1","1. In response to what may be an ordinary HTTP link, the"
"1.2.3.1","2","targeted file will be (a) retrieved from its server and (b)"
"1.2.3.1","3","dynamically &quot;translated&quot; into an Intermediary file"
"1.2.3.1","4","(I-File) with special structure and format implemented with"
"1.2.3.1","5","XML+."
"1.2.3.1.1","1","For any community seriously interested in applying HyperScope"
"1.2.3.1.1","2","(and the follow-on, full OHS), it is assumed that appropriate"
"1.2.3.1.1","3","&quot;translator modules&quot; will be developed for every"
"1.2.3.1.1","4","file/db type of significance to their collaborative efforts.  It"
"1.2.3.1.1","5","is expected that an increasing list of customized translators"
"1.2.3.1.1","6","will be developed as different application communities extend"
"1.2.3.1.1","7","the range of legacy files to be brought into integrated"
"1.2.3.1.1","8","HyperScope use."
"1.2.3.2","1","2. High-Resolution Addressability:   Translation into the"
"1.2.3.2","2","I-File's special structure and format creates, among other"
"1.2.3.2","3","things, new label tags attached to many objects (e.g. each"
"1.2.3.2","4","paragraph), so that links serviced by the HyperScope can"
"1.2.3.2","5","explicitly target many objects in the file which were not"
"1.2.3.2","6","addressable in their &quot;legacy&quot; form.  Ideally, every"
"1.2.3.2","7","object in a file should be targetable by a link whose author"
"1.2.3.2","8","wants to comment specifically about that object."
"1.2.3.2.1","1","E.g., here &quot;http://xxx.xxx.xxx#aaa&quot; targets a specific"
"1.2.3.2.1","2","object, assumedly not labelled in the legacy file, but given the"
"1.2.3.2.1","3","&quot;aaa&quot; label by the Translator any time that it"
"1.2.3.2.1","4","translates that targeted file into the I-File format."
"1.2.3.3","1","3. View-Specifications:  The HyperScope will offer a set of"
"1.2.3.3","2","&quot;transcoded viewing options&quot; which a user can"
"1.2.3.3","3","selectively employ to examine that file.  Simple example: just"
"1.2.3.3","4","show me the first line of each paragraph."
"1.2.3.3.1","1","From past experience it is expected that users will invent many"
"1.2.3.3.1","2","variations of the ways they would like to view portions of their"
"1.2.3.3.1","3","files, under different circumstances, often shifting rapidly"
"1.2.3.3.1","4","between views just as one might rotate a physical object, or"
"1.2.3.3.1","5","shift its distance, to get a better understanding of what is"
"1.2.3.3.1","6","there."
"1.2.3.3.2","1","It is planned to enable the option of incorporating a &quot;view"
"1.2.3.3.2","2","specification&quot; (viewspec) to a link so that a subsequent"
"1.2.3.3.2","3","user will not only have execution of that link take him to the"
"1.2.3.3.2","4","desired specific file location, but will also show the contents"
"1.2.3.3.2","5","there with the specified view."
"1.2.3.3.3","1","Considerable evolution is expected to take place here.  In the"
"1.2.3.3.3","2","&quot;open-source&quot; mode, many groups would be experimenting"
"1.2.3.3.3","3","and tuning, contributing to the evolution."
"1.2.3.4","1","4. Expanded set of HyperScope accessable &quot;Legacy File"
"1.2.3.4","2","Types:&quot;  In principle, this manner of HyperScope access can"
"1.2.3.4","3","be implemented for any standard type of file or data base.  The"
"1.2.3.4","4","Project will establish the basic implementation conventions, and"
"1.2.3.4","5","proceed to develop the translation and special I-File properties"
"1.2.3.4","6","appropriate for a selected sequence of file/db types -- planning"
"1.2.3.4","7","tentatively for those to be used by:"
"1.2.3.4.1","1","4a. the OHS-dev community (including open-source participants);"
"1.2.3.4.2","1","4b. the Software Productivity Consortium's member community:"
"1.2.3.4.3","1","4c. communities selected with NIH (and possibly cooperatively"
"1.2.3.4.3","2","with DARPA) for strategic progression of co-evolving tool- and"
"1.2.3.4.3","3","community-development  processes."
"1.2.3.4.4","1","Note:  Here again, it is planned to facilitate Open-Source"
"1.2.3.4.4","2","development so that many individuals and application communities"
"1.2.3.4.4","3","can pursue specialty application needs and possibilities."
"1.2.3.4.4","4","(Facilitating this evolution is planned.)"
"1.2.3.5","1","5. Copying-Pasting HyperScope Links:  When viewing a legacy file"
"1.2.3.5","2","via his HyperScope, a user will easily be able to install a"
"1.2.3.5","3","HyperScope link (HS-Link) in any legacy file, targeting an"
"1.2.3.5","4","explicit location in the file being viewed on his HyperScope."
"1.2.3.5","5","Clicking on the desired target object in a HyperScope &quot;Copy"
"1.2.3.5","6","mode,&quot; he can subsequently turn to the &quot;legacy"
"1.2.3.5","7","editor&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; the appropriate link into the"
"1.2.3.5","8","legacy file.  Later execution of that link will take any"
"1.2.3.5","9","subsequent HyperScope user to the desired, specific location and"
"1.2.3.5","10","with the specified view."
"1.2.3.6","1","6. Back-Link Management:   Provision will be made to capture"
"1.2.3.6","2","information about links pointing through the HyperScopes into a"
"1.2.3.6","3","specified collection of files, to establish a &quot;Back-Link"
"1.2.3.6","4","Data Base&quot; (BLDB).  For each such link, information to be"
"1.2.3.6","5","captured would be such as:"
"1.2.3.6.1","1","6a. Explicit target object being cited;"
"1.2.3.6.2","1","6b. The &quot;foreign&quot; location of the link;"
"1.2.3.6.2.1","1","NOTE: both 6a and 6b being very much more usefully explicit if"
"1.2.3.6.2.1","2","exercised via HyperScope use."
"1.2.3.6.3","1","6c. The author of that other-file citation link."
"1.2.3.6.4","1","6d. The &quot;Type&quot; of link citation, as per the vocabulary"
"1.2.3.6.4","2","of &quot;link typing&quot; adopted by the usage community, and"
"1.2.3.6.4","3","provided for inclusion in &quot;link syntax&quot; by appropriate"
"1.2.3.6.4","4","standardization processes."
"1.2.3.6.4.1","1","NOTE: Link Typing has been advocated and discused for many"
"1.2.3.6.4.1","2","years.  With the above HyperScope-facilitated LDB, link-type"
"1.2.3.6.4.1","3","utilization within appropriately developed community conventions"
"1.2.3.6.4.1","4","and practices, would offer very important enhanced capability"
"1.2.3.6.4.1","5","for collective knowledge development."
"1.2.3.6.4.2","1","AND, in a larger sense, it would enable a practical way to"
"1.2.3.6.4.2","2","improve on the established academic convention of only"
"1.2.3.6.4.2","3","publishing AFTER appropriate peer review (with attendant time"
"1.2.3.6.4.2","4","delays in the cycle of knowedge evolution)."
"1.2.3.6.4.3","1","HERE, a promising alternative is offered: Publish now, let Peer"
"1.2.3.6.4.3","2","Review and &quot;evolving attribution&quot; take place after."
"1.2.3.6.4.3","3","I.e., much more than just counting citations can here provide"
"1.2.3.6.4.3","4","effectively attributed peer evaluation: explicit back-link"
"1.2.3.6.4.3","5","assessment of trails can operate in many complex knowledge-"
"1.2.3.6.4.3","6","evolution environments to isolate the key contributions (and"
"1.2.3.6.4.3","7","also the key misleading entries)."
"1.2.3.7","1","7. Extended  addressing conventions to improve linking power:"
"1.2.3.7.1","1","7a. Relative Addressing: A conventional URL with a"
"1.2.3.7.1","2","&quot;#label&quot; extension can position the HyperScope at a"
"1.2.3.7.1","3","given object in the target file.  Extended conventions will"
"1.2.3.7.1","4","enable the link to point to subordinate objects -- e.g., to a"
"1.2.3.7.1","5","word in a paragraph, to an expressiion in an equation, ..."
"1.2.3.7.2","1","7b. Indirect Linking: A very powerful extension to the relative"
"1.2.3.7.2","2","addressing is a convention which directs the HyperScope to go to"
"1.2.3.7.2","3","a specific location and then follow the link at that position --"
"1.2.3.7.2","4","and perhaps at the link's destination to do further relative"
"1.2.3.7.2","5","positioning and &quot;link following.&quot;  This indirect"
"1.2.3.7.2","6","linking provides very powerful functionality when users learn to"
"1.2.3.7.2","7","harness it."
"1.2.3.7.3","1","7c. Implicit Linking: Example -- every word is implicitly linked"
"1.2.3.7.3","2","to its definition in a dictionary; every special term is"
"1.2.3.7.3","3","implicitly linked to its definition in that discipline's"
"1.2.3.7.3","4","glossary; every instance of an object's name in a source-code"
"1.2.3.7.3","5","file is implicitly linked to its imlementation code; ...; every"
"1.2.3.7.3","6","pronoun is implicitly linked to its antecedent.  Special"
"1.2.3.7.3","7","&quot;jump&quot; commands can be provided which can operate as"
"1.2.3.7.3","8","though the term in question is explicitly linked to the"
"1.2.3.7.3","9","&quot;implicitly linked&quot; object.  (Jump to Definition, ...)"
"1.2.3.8","1","8. Same file in multiple windows -- no real limit there --"
"1.2.3.8","2","simultaneously allowing different positioning and differnet"
"1.2.3.8","3","viewing portrayals of a given file."
"1.2.3.8.1","1","Later, when editing of the Intermediary File will be offered,"
"1.2.3.8.1","2","any legal edit operation executed in one window is reflected"
"1.2.3.8.1","3","accurately and immediately in all other of that file's portrayal"
"1.2.3.8.1","4","windows."
"1.2.3.8.2","1","This flexibility in utilizing multiple windows has surprising"
"1.2.3.8.2","2","value when users learn to make effective use of it."
"1.2.3.9","1","9. Non-Link Jumps; Options offered via simple selection means --"
"1.2.3.9","2","E.g.:"
"1.2.3.9.1","1","A click in a given paragraph, not on an embedded link, would"
"1.2.3.9.1","2","hoist that paragraph to the top of the window."
"1.2.3.9.2","1","Click-select a given paragraph, then Jump Next, Last, First,"
"1.2.3.9.2","2","Origin, ..."
"1.2.3.10","1","10. Double-click Jumps offer surprisingly flexible options:"
"1.2.3.10.1","1","First click indicates what jump is desired; second click can be"
"1.2.3.10.1","2","in any other window, indicating where the jump-result view is to"
"1.2.3.10.1","3","be portrayed. Whatever viewing spec already established in the"
"1.2.3.10.1","4","target window will also prevail when the jumped-to file/location"
"1.2.3.10.1","5","is portrayed there."
"1.2.3.10.2","1","Also, in the interval between window clicks, icon or menu"
"1.2.3.10.2","2","clicks, or character input, can indicate the new viewing spec if"
"1.2.3.10.2","3","the user desires something different from what is currently set"
"1.2.3.10.2","4","for the target window."
"1.2.3.10.3","1","For instance:  Window 1 could be relatively narrow, with view"
"1.2.3.10.3","2","spec set for small font and only first line of each paragraph"
"1.2.3.10.3","3","portrayed; Window 2 wider, with larger, more-readable font and"
"1.2.3.10.3","4","full-paragraph portrayal."
"1.2.3.11","1","We assume that the above capabilities would be useful to almost"
"1.2.3.11","2","any collaborative community, essentially as soon as adequate"
"1.2.3.11","3","HyperScope-application support services could be provided."
"1.2.3.11","4","(NOTE that a qualified SRI group is explicitly set now to"
"1.2.3.11","5","establish and operate such servics.  Optional whether"
"1.2.3.11","6","arrangements for this are pre-established at outset of the"
"1.2.3.11","7","&quot;OHS-dev Project&quot;, or later when support of a"
"1.2.3.11","8","particular community choose to become involved.  In any event,"
"1.2.3.11","9","suitable lead time needs be allowed.)"
"1.3","1","Phase-2: Maturing/Evolving the Hyperscope into full-feature OHS:"
"1.3.1","1","Evolution of the Intermediary File format will be given careful"
"1.3.1","2","attention since it is destined to become the format for the full"
"1.3.1","3","Open Hyperdocument System (which will continue its evolution)."
"1.3.2","1","An OHS &quot;User Interface System&quot; (UIS) will be developed"
"1.3.2","2","to provide a basic range of functions for moving, viewing and"
"1.3.2","3","editing."
"1.3.3","1","Provision for archiving, version control, etc. will be developed"
"1.3.3","2","so that it becomes possible to develop and maintain an evolving"
"1.3.3","3","knowledge base soley within an OHS environment -- with"
"1.3.3","4","integrated flexibility and power accumulated from the best that"
"1.3.3","5","was accomplished via HyperScope usage among the legacy files."
"1.3.4","1","Now the VERY important feature of this approach to OHS"
"1.3.4","2","development comes into play: task by task, or person by person,"
"1.3.4","3","in almost any order and rate, users can start to keep their"
"1.3.4","4","files entirely within the OHS environment.  All the working"
"1.3.4","5","material is still interlinkable, whether in OHS or legacy files."
"1.3.5","1","And the critical community-development processes will become"
"1.3.5","2","VERY important here -- to start the active &quot;co-"
"1.3.5","3","evolution&quot; of the &quot;Human System&quot; and the OHS"
"1.3.5","4","&quot;Tool System&quot; (as discussed at length in the"
"1.3.5","5","&quot;Bootstrap Publications&quot;)."
"1.3.6","1","For the scale of utilization that will be necessary, in number"
"1.3.6","2","of inter-operating groups, in the diversity of inter-operable"
"1.3.6","3","knowledge domains, and in the continuing changes in tools and"
"1.3.6","4","skills, processes, etc. -- it will be absolutely critical that"
"1.3.6.1","1","(a) the Tool System be as open to continuing evolution as can be"
"1.3.6.1","2","managed, and"
"1.3.6.2","1","(b) the application communities be specifically organized to"
"1.3.6.2","2","participate pro-actively in the Human-Tool co-evolution."
"1.3.7","1","It is sincerely hoped that organizations investing in the"
"1.3.7","2","Stage-1 HyperScope development and use will do so with clear"
"1.3.7","3","intent to be simultaneously readying their targeted application"
"1.3.7","4","communities for becoming pro-active, &quot;evolutionary"
"1.3.7","5","participants.&quot;"
"1.4","1","Phase-3: Special Evolutionary Provision: Multi-class UIS"
"1.4","2","Architecture and High-Performance Teams."
"1.4.1","1","The OHS Interface Architecture will be set up explicitly to"
"1.4.1","2","provide for multiple UIS options, with a common, full-feature"
"1.4.1","3","Application Program Interface (API).  To support extensive"
"1.4.1","4","capability evolution, it will be necesary to provide for a range"
"1.4.1","5","of UIS options, varying in complexity, potential competency"
"1.4.1","6","level, difficulty to learn, types of interface devices and"
"1.4.1","7","modalities, etc."
"1.4.1.1","1","Being able effectively to support web-connected mobile phones is"
"1.4.1.1","2","one example."
"1.4.2","1","But a VERY IMPORTANT purpose here is to enable individuals, or"
"1.4.2","2","special-role support teams, to experiment with interface"
"1.4.2","3","equipment, functionality, and control options, together with"
"1.4.2","4","optional special attributes of the standard Intermediary File,"
"1.4.2","5","to pursue especially high performance at important parts of"
"1.4.2","6","their knowledge processes."
"1.4.3","1","Having this kind of exploration in any event will be necessary."
"1.4.3","2","Doing it with special extensions to the widely used OHS will be"
"1.4.3","3","very important in enabling feasible migration of these tools and"
"1.4.3","4","skills out into the rest of the communities.  Moreover, doing"
"1.4.3","5","this exploratory high-performance activity over the SAME WORKING"
"1.4.3","6","domains amplifies that benefit immensely; motivated individuals"
"1.4.3","7","can optionally acquire special interface equipment, take some"
"1.4.3","8","special training, and move up to a &quot;new class of user"
"1.4.3","9","proficiency&quot; (e.g. becoming a certified Class-4B Knowledge"
"1.4.3","10","Integrator)."
"1.4.4","1","There are support roles anticipated in developing and"
"1.4.4","2","maintaining a community's Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR)"
"1.4.4","3","which could very well be taken on by specially trained High-"
"1.4.4","4","Performance Support Teams.  Such a team could for instance be"
"1.4.4","5","fielded in a university (as a research project into High-"
"1.4.4","6","Performance Collective Knowledge Work), and take on the"
"1.4.4","7","&quot;Knowledge Integrator&quot; role for a professional"
"1.4.4","8","society's DKR.  And competetive exercises could be conducted"
"1.4.4","9","among teams from different universities -- or companies, or"
"1.4.4","10","agencies, or countries -- as part of an explicit processes to"
"1.4.4","11","facilitate improvement in &quot;Collective IQ.&quot;"
