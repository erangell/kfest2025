"1.1","1","I. INTRODUCTION"
"1.1.1","1","A. GENERAL"
"1.1.1.1","1","By &quot;augmenting human intellect&quot; we mean increasing the"
"1.1.1.1","2","capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to"
"1.1.1.1","3","gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive"
"1.1.1.1","4","solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is"
"1.1.1.1","5","taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid"
"1.1.1.1","6","comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining"
"1.1.1.1","7","a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously"
"1.1.1.1","8","was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the"
"1.1.1.1","9","possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed"
"1.1.1.1","10","insoluble. And by &quot;complex situations&quot; we include the"
"1.1.1.1","11","professional problems of diplomats, executives, social"
"1.1.1.1","12","scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys,"
"1.1.1.1","13","designers--whether the problem situation exists for twenty"
"1.1.1.1","14","minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever"
"1.1.1.1","15","tricks that help in particular situations.  We refer to a way of"
"1.1.1.1","16","life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try,"
"1.1.1.1","17","intangibles, and the human &quot;feel for a situation&quot;"
"1.1.1.1","18","usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined"
"1.1.1.1","19","terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-"
"1.1.1.1","20","powered electronic aids."
"1.1.1.2","1","Man's population and gross product are increasing at a"
"1.1.1.2","2","considerable rate, but the <i>complexity</i> of his problems"
"1.1.1.2","3","grows still faster, and the <i>urgency</i> with which solutions"
"1.1.1.2","4","must be found becomes steadily greater in response to the"
"1.1.1.2","5","increased rate of activity and the increasingly global nature of"
"1.1.1.2","6","that activity. Augmenting man's intellect, in the sense defined"
"1.1.1.2","7","above, would warrant full pursuit by an enlightened society if"
"1.1.1.2","8","there could be shown a reasonable approach and some plausible"
"1.1.1.2","9","benefits."
"1.1.1.3","1","This report covers the first phase of a program aimed at"
"1.1.1.3","2","developing means to augment the human intellect. These"
"1.1.1.3","3","&quot;means&quot; can include many things--all of which appear"
"1.1.1.3","4","to be but extensions of means developed andused in the past to"
"1.1.1.3","5","help man apply his native sensory, mental, and motor"
"1.1.1.3","6","capabilities--and we consider the whole system of a human and"
"1.1.1.3","7","his augmentation means as a proper field of search for practical"
"1.1.1.3","8","possibilities. It is a very important system to our society, and"
"1.1.1.3","9","like most systems its performance can best be improved by"
"1.1.1.3","10","considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather"
"1.1.1.3","11","than by considering the components in isolation."
"1.1.1.4","1","This kind of system approach to human intellectual effectiveness"
"1.1.1.4","2","does not find a ready-made conceptual framework such as exists"
"1.1.1.4","3","for established disciplines. Before a research program can be"
"1.1.1.4","4","designed to pursue such an approach intelligently, so that"
"1.1.1.4","5","practical benefits might be derived within a reasonable time"
"1.1.1.4","6","while also producing results of longrange significance, a"
"1.1.1.4","7","conceptual framework must be searched out--a framework that"
"1.1.1.4","8","provides orientation as to the important factors of the system,"
"1.1.1.4","9","the relationships among these factors, the types of change among"
"1.1.1.4","10","the system factors that offer likely improvements in"
"1.1.1.4","11","performance, and the sort of research goals and methodology that"
"1.1.1.4","12","seem promising.<a href=&quot;#Notes-1-1&quot;>1</a>"
"1.1.1.5","1","In the first (search) phase of our program we have developed a"
"1.1.1.5","2","conceptual framework that seems satisfactory for the current"
"1.1.1.5","3","needs of designing a research phase. Section II contains the"
"1.1.1.5","4","essence of this framework as derived from several different ways"
"1.1.1.5","5","of looking at the system made up of a human and his intellect-"
"1.1.1.5","6","augmentation means."
"1.1.1.6","1","The process of developing this conceptual framework brought out"
"1.1.1.6","2","a number of significant realizations: that the intellectual"
"1.1.1.6","3","effectiveness exercised today by a given human has little"
"1.1.1.6","4","likelihood of being intelligence limited--that there are dozens"
"1.1.1.6","5","of disciplines in engineering, mathematics, and the social,"
"1.1.1.6","6","life, and physical sciences that can contribute improvements to"
"1.1.1.6","7","the system of intellect-augmentation means; that any one such"
"1.1.1.6","8","improvement can be expected to trigger a chain of"
"1.1.1.6","9","coordinatingimprovements; that until every one of these"
"1.1.1.6","10","disciplines comes to a standstill and we have exhausted all the"
"1.1.1.6","11","improvement possibilities we could glean from it, we can expect"
"1.1.1.6","12","to continue to develop improvements in this human-intellect"
"1.1.1.6","13","system; that there is no particular reason not to expect gains"
"1.1.1.6","14","in personal intellectual effectiveness from a concerted"
"1.1.1.6","15","systemoriented approach that compare to those made in personal"
"1.1.1.6","16","geographic mobility since horseback and sailboat days."
"1.1.1.7","1","The picture of how one can view the possibilities for a"
"1.1.1.7","2","systematic approach to increasing human intellectual"
"1.1.1.7","3","effectiveness, as put forth in Section II in the sober and"
"1.1.1.7","4","general terms of an initial basic analysis, does not seem to"
"1.1.1.7","5","convey all of the richness and promise that was stimulated by"
"1.1.1.7","6","the development of that picture. Consequently, Section III is"
"1.1.1.7","7","intended to present some definite images that illustrate"
"1.1.1.7","8","meaningful possibilities deriveable from the conceptual"
"1.1.1.7","9","framework presented in Section II--and in a rather marked"
"1.1.1.7","10","deviation from ordinary technical writing, a good portion of"
"1.1.1.7","11","Section III presents these images in a fiction-dialogue style as"
"1.1.1.7","12","a mechanism for transmitting a feeling for the richness and"
"1.1.1.7","13","promise of the possibilities in one region of the improvement"
"1.1.1.7","14","space&quot; that is roughly mapped in Section II."
"1.1.1.8","1","The style of Section III seems to make for easier reading. If"
"1.1.1.8","2","Section II begins to seem unrewardingly difficult, the reader"
"1.1.1.8","3","may find it helpful to skip from Section II-B directly to"
"1.1.1.8","4","Section III. If it serves its purpose well enough, Section III"
"1.1.1.8","5","will provide a context within which the reader can go back and"
"1.1.1.8","6","finish Section II with less effort."
"1.1.1.9","1","In Section IV (Research Recommendations) we present a general"
"1.1.1.9","2","strategy for pursuing research toward increasing human"
"1.1.1.9","3","intellectual effectiveness.  This strategy evolved directly from"
"1.1.1.9","4","the concepts presented in Sections II and III; one of its"
"1.1.1.9","5","important precepts is to pursue the quickest gains first, and"
"1.1.1.9","6","use the increased intellectual effectiveness thus derived to"
"1.1.1.9","7","help pursue successive gains. We see the quickest gains emerging"
"1.1.1.9","8","from (1) giving the human the minute-by-minute services of a"
"1.1.1.9","9","digital computer equipped with computer-driven cathode-ray-tube"
"1.1.1.9","10","display, and (2) developing the new methods of thinking and"
"1.1.1.9","11","working that allow the human to capitalizeupon the computer's"
"1.1.1.9","12","help. By this same strategy, we recommend that an initial"
"1.1.1.9","13","research effort develop a prototype system of this sort aimed at"
"1.1.1.9","14","increasing human effectiveness in the task of computer"
"1.1.1.9","15","programming."
"1.1.1.10","1","To give the reader an initial orientation about what sort of"
"1.1.1.10","2","thing this computer-aided working system might be, we include"
"1.1.1.10","3","below a short description of a possible system of this sort."
"1.1.1.10","4","This illustrative example is not to be considered a description"
"1.1.1.10","5","of the actual system that will emerge from the program. It is"
"1.1.1.10","6","given only to show the general direction of the work, and is"
"1.1.1.10","7","clothed in fiction only to make it easier to visualize."
"1.1.1.11","1","Let us consider an augmented architect at work. He sits at a"
"1.1.1.11","2","working station that has a visual display screen some three feet"
"1.1.1.11","3","on a side; this is his working surface, and is controlled by a"
"1.1.1.11","4","computer (his &quot;clerk&quot; ) with which he can communicate"
"1.1.1.11","5","by means of a small keyboard and various other devices."
"1.1.1.12","1","He is designing a building. He has already dreamed up several"
"1.1.1.12","2","basic layouts and structural forms, and is trying them out on"
"1.1.1.12","3","the screen. The surveying data for the layout he is working on"
"1.1.1.12","4","now have already been entered, and he has just coaxed the clerk"
"1.1.1.12","5","to show him a perspective view of the steep hillside building"
"1.1.1.12","6","site with the roadway above, symbolic representations of the"
"1.1.1.12","7","various trees that are to remain on the lot, and the service tie"
"1.1.1.12","8","points for the different utilities. The view occupies the left"
"1.1.1.12","9","two-thirds of the screen. With a &quot;pointer,&quot; he"
"1.1.1.12","10","indicates two points of interest, moves his left hand rapidly"
"1.1.1.12","11","over the keyboard, and the distance and elevation between the"
"1.1.1.12","12","points indicated appear on the right- hand third of the screen."
"1.1.1.13","1","Now he enters a reference line with his pointer, and the"
"1.1.1.13","2","keyboard. Gradually the screen begins to show the work he is"
"1.1.1.13","3","doing--a neat excavation appears in the hillside) revises itself"
"1.1.1.13","4","slightly, and revises itself again. After a moment, the"
"1.1.1.13","5","architect changes the scene on the screen to an overhead plan"
"1.1.1.13","6","view of the site, still showing the excavation. A few minutes of"
"1.1.1.13","7","study, and he enters on the keyboard a list of items, checking"
"1.1.1.13","8","each one as it appears on the screen, to be studied later."
"1.1.1.14","1","Ignoring the representation on the display, the architect next"
"1.1.1.14","2","begins to enter a series of specifications and data--a six-inch"
"1.1.1.14","3","slab floor, twelve-inch concrete walls eight feet high within"
"1.1.1.14","4","the excavation, and so on. When he has finished, the revised"
"1.1.1.14","5","scene appears on the screen. A structure is taking shape. He"
"1.1.1.14","6","examines it, adjusts it, pauses long enough to ask for handbook"
"1.1.1.14","7","or catalog information from the clerk at various points, and"
"1.1.1.14","8","reacijusts accordingly. He often recalls from the"
"1.1.1.14","9","&quot;clerk&quot; his working lists of specifications and"
"1.1.1.14","10","considerations to refer to them, modify them, or add to them."
"1.1.1.14","11","These lists grow into an evermore-detailed, interlinked"
"1.1.1.14","12","structure, which represents the maturing thought behind the"
"1.1.1.14","13","actual design."
"1.1.1.15","1","Prescribing different planes here and there, curved surfaces"
"1.1.1.15","2","occasionally, and moving the whole structure about five feet, he"
"1.1.1.15","3","finally has the rough external form of the building balanced"
"1.1.1.15","4","nicely with the setting and he is assured that this form is"
"1.1.1.15","5","basically compatible with the materials to be used as well as"
"1.1.1.15","6","with the function of the building."
"1.1.1.16","1","Now he begins to enter detailed information about the interior."
"1.1.1.16","2","Here the capability of the clerk to show him any view he wants"
"1.1.1.16","3","to examine (a slice of the interior, or how the structure would"
"1.1.1.16","4","look from the roadway above) is important. He enters particular"
"1.1.1.16","5","fixture designs, and examines them in a particular room. He"
"1.1.1.16","6","checks to make sure that sun glare from the windows will not"
"1.1.1.16","7","blind a driver on the roadway, and the &quot;clerk&quot;"
"1.1.1.16","8","computes the information that one window will reflect strongly"
"1.1.1.16","9","onto the roadway between 6 and 6:30 on midsummer mornings."
"1.1.1.17","1","Next he begins a functional analysis. He has a list of the"
"1.1.1.17","2","people who will occupy this building, and the daily sequences of"
"1.1.1.17","3","their activtites.  The &quot;clerk&quot; allows him to follow"
"1.1.1.17","4","each in turn, examining how doors swing, where special lighting"
"1.1.1.17","5","might be needed. Finally he has the &quot;clerk&quot; combine"
"1.1.1.17","6","all of these sequences of activity to indicate spots where"
"1.1.1.17","7","traffic is heavy in the building, or where congestion might"
"1.1.1.17","8","occur, and to determine what the severest drain on the utilities"
"1.1.1.17","9","is likely to be."
"1.1.1.18","1","All of this information (the building design and its associated"
"1.1.1.18","2","&quot;thought structure&quot;) can be stored on a tape to"
"1.1.1.18","3","represent the design manual for the building. Loading this tape"
"1.1.1.18","4","into his own clerk, another architect, a builder, or the client"
"1.1.1.18","5","can maneuver within this design manual to pursue whatever"
"1.1.1.18","6","details or insights are of interest to him--and can append"
"1.1.1.18","7","special notes that are integrated into the design manual for his"
"1.1.1.18","8","own or someone else's later benefit."
"1.1.1.19","1","In such a future working relationship between human problem-"
"1.1.1.19","2","solver and computer 'clerk,' the capability of the computer for"
"1.1.1.19","3","executing mathematical processes would be used whenever it was"
"1.1.1.19","4","needed. However, the computer has many other capabilities for"
"1.1.1.19","5","manipulating and displaying information that can be of"
"1.1.1.19","6","significant benefit to the human in nonmathematical processes of"
"1.1.1.19","7","planning, organizing, studying, etc. Every person who does his"
"1.1.1.19","8","thinking with symbolized concepts (whether in the form of the"
"1.1.1.19","9","English language, pictographs, formal logic, or mathematics)"
"1.1.1.19","10","should be able to benefit significantly."
"1.1.2","1","B. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY"
"1.1.2.1","1","The objective of this study is to develop a conceptual framework"
"1.1.2.1","2","within which could grow a coordinated research and development"
"1.1.2.1","3","program whose goals would be the following: (1) to find the"
"1.1.2.1","4","factors that limit the effectiveness of the individual's basic"
"1.1.2.1","5","information-handling capabilities in meeting the various needs"
"1.1.2.1","6","of society for problem solving in its most general sense; and"
"1.1.2.1","7","(2) to develop new techniques, procedures, and systems that will"
"1.1.2.1","8","better match these basic capabilities to the needs' problems,"
"1.1.2.1","9","and progress of society. We have placed the following"
"1.1.2.1","10","specifications on this framework:"
"1.1.2.1.1","1","1. That it provide perspective for both long-range basic"
"1.1.2.1.1","2","research and research that will yield practical results soon."
"1.1.2.1.2","1","2. That it indicate what this augmentation will actually involve"
"1.1.2.1.2","2","in the way of changes in working environment, in thinking, in"
"1.1.2.1.2","3","skills, and in methods of working."
"1.1.2.1.3","1","3. That it be a basis for evaluating the possible relevance of"
"1.1.2.1.3","2","work and knowledge from existing fields and for assimilating"
"1.1.2.1.3","3","whatever is relevant."
"1.1.2.1.4","1","4. That it reveal areas where research is possible and ways to"
"1.1.2.1.4","2","assess the research, be a basis for choosing starting points,"
"1.1.2.1.4","3","and indicate how to develop appropriate methodologies for the"
"1.1.2.1.4","4","needed research."
"1.1.2.2","1","Two points need emphasis here. First, although a conceptual"
"1.1.2.2","2","framework has been constructed, it is still rudimentary. Further"
"1.1.2.2","3","search, and actual research, are needed for the evolution of the"
"1.1.2.2","4","framework. Second, even if our conceptual framework did provide"
"1.1.2.2","5","an accurate and complete basic analysis of the system from which"
"1.1.2.2","6","stems a human's intellectual effectiveness, the explicit nature"
"1.1.2.2","7","of future improved systems would be highly affected by"
"1.1.2.2","8","(expected) changes in our technology or in our understanding of"
"1.1.2.2","9","the human being."
"1.2","1","II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK"
"1.2.1","1","A. GENERAL"
"1.2.1.1","1","The conceptual framework we seek must orient us toward the real"
"1.2.1.1","2","possibilities and problems associated with using modern"
"1.2.1.1","3","technology to give direct aid to an individual in comprehending"
"1.2.1.1","4","complex situations, isolating the significant factors, and"
"1.2.1.1","5","solving problems. To gain this orientation, we examine how"
"1.2.1.1","6","individuals achieve their present level of effectiveness, and"
"1.2.1.1","7","expect that this examination will reveal possibilities for"
"1.2.1.1","8","improvement."
"1.2.1.2","1","The entire effect of an individual on the world stems"
"1.2.1.2","2","essentially from what he can transmit to the world through his"
"1.2.1.2","3","limited motor channels. This in turn is based on information"
"1.2.1.2","4","received from the outside world through limited sensory"
"1.2.1.2","5","channels; on information, drives, and needs generated within"
"1.2.1.2","6","him; and on his processing of that information. His processing"
"1.2.1.2","7","is of two kinds: that which he is generally conscious of"
"1.2.1.2","8","(recognizing patterns, remembering, visualizing, abstracting,"
"1.2.1.2","9","deducing, inducing, etc.), and that involving the unconscious"
"1.2.1.2","10","processing and mediating of received and self-generated"
"1.2.1.2","11","information, and the unconscious mediating of conscious"
"1.2.1.2","12","processing itself."
"1.2.1.3","1","The individual does not use this information and this processing"
"1.2.1.3","2","to grapple directly with the sort of complex situation in which"
"1.2.1.3","3","we seek to give him help. He uses his innate capabilities in a"
"1.2.1.3","4","rather more indirect fashion, since the situation is generally"
"1.2.1.3","5","too complex to yield directly to his motor actions, and always"
"1.2.1.3","6","too complex to yield comprehensions and solutions from direct"
"1.2.1.3","7","sensory inspection and use of basic cognitive capabilities. For"
"1.2.1.3","8","instance, an aborigine who possesses all of our basic sensory-"
"1.2.1.3","9","mental-motor capabilities, but does not possess our background"
"1.2.1.3","10","of indirect knowledge and procedure, cannot organize the proper"
"1.2.1.3","11","direct actions necessary to drive a car through traffic, request"
"1.2.1.3","12","a book from the library, call a committee meeting to discuss a"
"1.2.1.3","13","tentative plan, call someone on the telephone, or compose a"
"1.2.1.3","14","letter on the typewriter."
"1.2.1.4","1","Our culture has evolved means for us to organize the little"
"1.2.1.4","2","things we can do with our <i>basic</i> capabilities so that we"
"1.2.1.4","3","can derive comprehension from truly complex situations, and"
"1.2.1.4","4","accomplish the processes of deriving and implementing problem"
"1.2.1.4","5","solutions. The ways in which human capabilities are thus"
"1.2.1.4","6","extended are here called augmentation means, and we define four"
"1.2.1.4","7","basic classes of them:"
"1.2.1.4.1","1","1. <i>Artifacts</i>--physical objects designed to provide for"
"1.2.1.4.1","2","human comfort, for the manipulation of things or materials, and"
"1.2.1.4.1","3","for the manipulation of symbols."
"1.2.1.4.2","1","2. <i>Language</i>--the way in which the individual parcels out"
"1.2.1.4.2","2","the picture of his world into the concepts that his mind uses to"
"1.2.1.4.2","3","model that world, and the symbols that he attaches to those"
"1.2.1.4.2","4","concepts and uses in consciously manipulating the concepts"
"1.2.1.4.2","5","(&quot;thinking&quot;)."
"1.2.1.4.3","1","3. <i>Methodology</i>--the methods, procedures, strategies,"
"1.2.1.4.3","2","etc., with which an individual organizes his <i>goal-"
"1.2.1.4.3","3","centered</i> (problem-solving) activity."
"1.2.1.4.4","1","4. <i>Training</i>--the conditioning needed by the human being"
"1.2.1.4.4","2","to bring his skills in using Means 1, 2, and 3 to the point"
"1.2.1.4.4","3","where they are operationally effective."
"1.2.1.5","1","The system we want to improve can thus be visualized as a"
"1.2.1.5","2","trained human being together with his artifacts, language, and"
"1.2.1.5","3","methodology. The explicit new system we contemplate will involve"
"1.2.1.5","4","as artifacts computers, and computer-controlled information-"
"1.2.1.5","5","storage, information-handling, and information-display devices."
"1.2.1.5","6","The aspects of the conceptual framework that are discussed here"
"1.2.1.5","7","are primarily those relating to the human being's ability to"
"1.2.1.5","8","make significant use of such equipment in an integrated system."
"1.2.1.6","1","Pervading all of the augmentation means is a particular"
"1.2.1.6","2","structure or organization. While an untrained aborigine cannot"
"1.2.1.6","3","drive a car through traffic, because he cannot leap the gap"
"1.2.1.6","4","between his cultural background and the kind of world that"
"1.2.1.6","5","contains cars and traffic, it is possible to move step by step"
"1.2.1.6","6","through an organized training program that will enable him to"
"1.2.1.6","7","drive effectively and safely. In other words, the human mind"
"1.2.1.6","8","neither learns nor acts by large leaps, but by steps organized"
"1.2.1.6","9","or structured so that each one depends upon previous steps."
"1.2.1.7","1","Although the size of the step a human being can take in"
"1.2.1.7","2","comprehension, innovation, or execution is small in comparison"
"1.2.1.7","3","to the over-all size of the step needed to solve a complex"
"1.2.1.7","4","problem, human beings nevertheless do solve complex problems. It"
"1.2.1.7","5","is the augmentation means that serve to break down a large"
"1.2.1.7","6","problem in such a way that the human being can walk through it"
"1.2.1.7","7","with his little steps, and it is the structure or organization"
"1.2.1.7","8","of these little steps or actions that we discuss as <i>process"
"1.2.1.7","9","hierarchies</i>."
"1.2.1.8","1","Every process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes."
"1.2.1.8","2","Let us consider such examples as making a pencil stroke, writing"
"1.2.1.8","3","a letter of the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete"
"1.2.1.8","4","muscle movements are organized into the making of a pencil"
"1.2.1.8","5","stroke; similarly, making particular pencil strokes and making a"
"1.2.1.8","6","plan for a letter are complex processes in themselves that"
"1.2.1.8","7","become sub-processes to the over-all writing of an alphabetic"
"1.2.1.8","8","character."
"1.2.1.9","1","Although every sub-process is a process in its own right, in"
"1.2.1.9","2","that it consists of further sub-processes, there seems to be no"
"1.2.1.9","3","point here in looking for the ultimate bottom of the process-"
"1.2.1.9","4","hierarchical structure. There seems to be no way of telling"
"1.2.1.9","5","whether or not the apparent bottoms (processes that cannot be"
"1.2.1.9","6","further subdivided) exist in the physical world or in the"
"1.2.1.9","7","limitations of human understanding."
"1.2.1.10","1","In any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in"
"1.2.1.10","2","discussing particular process hierarchies. No person uses a"
"1.2.1.10","3","process that is completely unique every time he tackles"
"1.2.1.10","4","something new. Instead, he begins from a group of basic sensory-"
"1.2.1.10","5","mental-motor process capabilities, and adds to these certain of"
"1.2.1.10","6","the process capabilities of his artifacts. There are only a"
"1.2.1.10","7","finite number of such basic human and artifact capabilities from"
"1.2.1.10","8","which to draw. Furthermore, even quite different higher order"
"1.2.1.10","9","processes may have in common relatively high-order sub-"
"1.2.1.10","10","processes&quot;."
"1.2.1.11","1","When a man writes prose text (a reasonably high-order process),"
"1.2.1.11","2","he makes use of many processes as sub-processes that are common"
"1.2.1.11","3","to other high-order processes. For example, he makes use of"
"1.2.1.11","4","planning, composing, dictating.  The process of writing is"
"1.2.1.11","5","utilized as a sub-process within many different processes of a"
"1.2.1.11","6","still higher order, such as organizing a committee, changing a"
"1.2.1.11","7","policy, and so on."
"1.2.1.12","1","What happens, then, is that each individual develops a certain"
"1.2.1.12","2","repertoire of process capabilities from which he selects and"
"1.2.1.12","3","adapts those that will compose the processes that he executes."
"1.2.1.12","4","This repertoire is like a tool kit, and just as the mechanic"
"1.2.1.12","5","must know what his tools can do and how to use them, so the"
"1.2.1.12","6","intellectual worker must know the capabilities of his tools and"
"1.2.1.12","7","have good methods, strategies, and rules of thumb for making use"
"1.2.1.12","8","of them. All of the process capabilities in the individual's"
"1.2.1.12","9","repertoire rest ultimately upon basic capabilities within him or"
"1.2.1.12","10","his artifacts, and the entire repertoire represents an inter-"
"1.2.1.12","11","knit, hierarchical structure (which we often call the"
"1.2.1.12","12","<i>repertoire hierarchy</i>)."
"1.2.1.13","1","We find three general categories of process capabilities within"
"1.2.1.13","2","a typical individual's repertoire. There are those that are"
"1.2.1.13","3","executed completely within the human integument, which we call"
"1.2.1.13","4","explicit-human process capabilities; there are those possessed"
"1.2.1.13","5","by artifacts for executing processes without human intervention,"
"1.2.1.13","6","which we call <i>explicit-artifact</i> process capabilities; and"
"1.2.1.13","7","there are what we call the <i>composite</i> process"
"1.2.1.13","8","capabilities, which are derived from hierarchies containing both"
"1.2.1.13","9","of the other kinds."
"1.2.1.14","1","We assume that it is our H-LAM/T system (Human using Lauguage,"
"1.2.1.14","2","Artifacts, Methodology, in which he is Trained) that has the"
"1.2.1.14","3","capability and that performs the process in any instance of use"
"1.2.1.14","4","of this repertoire. Let us look within the process structure for"
"1.2.1.14","5","the LAM/T ingredients, to get a better &quot;feel&quot; for our"
"1.2.1.14","6","models. Consider the process of writing an important memo.There"
"1.2.1.14","7","is a particular concept associated with this process -- that of"
"1.2.1.14","8","putting information into a formal package and distributing it to"
"1.2.1.14","9","a set of people for a certain kind of consideration -- and the"
"1.2.1.14","10","type of information package associated with this concept has"
"1.2.1.14","11","been given the special name of <i>memorandum</i>.  Already the"
"1.2.1.14","12","system language shows the effect of this process--i.e., a"
"1.2.1.14","13","concept and its name."
"1.2.1.15","1","The memo-writing process may be executed by using a set of"
"1.2.1.15","2","process capabilities (in intermixed or repetitive form) such as"
"1.2.1.15","3","the following planning, developing subject matter, composing"
"1.2.1.15","4","text, producing hard copy, and distributing.  There is a"
"1.2.1.15","5","definite way in which these sub-processes will be organized that"
"1.2.1.15","6","represents part of the system methodology. Each of these sub-"
"1.2.1.15","7","processes represents a functional concept that must be a part of"
"1.2.1.15","8","the system language if it is to be organized effectively into"
"1.2.1.15","9","the human's way of doing things, and the symbolic portrayal of"
"1.2.1.15","10","each concept must be such that the human can work with it and"
"1.2.1.15","11","remember it."
"1.2.1.16","1","If the memo is simple, a paragraph or so in length, then the"
"1.2.1.16","2","first three processes may well be of the explicit-human type"
"1.2.1.16","3","(i.e., it may be planned, developed) and composed within the"
"1.2.1.16","4","mind) and the last two of the composite type. If it is a complex"
"1.2.1.16","5","memo, involving a good deal of careful planning and development,"
"1.2.1.16","6","then all of the sub-processes might well be of the composite"
"1.2.1.16","7","type (e.g., at least including the use of pencil and paper"
"1.2.1.16","8","artifacts)' and there might be many different applications of"
"1.2.1.16","9","some of the process capabilities within the total process (i.e.,"
"1.2.1.16","10","successive drafts, revised plans)."
"1.2.1.17","1","The set of sub-process capabilities discussed so far, if called"
"1.2.1.17","2","upon in proper occasion and sequence, would indeed enable the"
"1.2.1.17","3","execution of the memo-writing process. However, the very process"
"1.2.1.17","4","of organizing and supervising the utilization of these sub-"
"1.2.1.17","5","process capabilities is itself a most important sub-process of"
"1.2.1.17","6","the memo-writing process. Hence, the sub- process capabilities"
"1.2.1.17","7","as listed would not be complete without the addition of a"
"1.2.1.17","8","seventh capability--what we call the <i>executive</i>"
"1.2.1.17","9","capability. This is the capability stemming from habit,"
"1.2.1.17","10","strategy, rules of thumb, prejudice, learned method, intuition,"
"1.2.1.17","11","unconscious dictates, or combinations thereof, to call upon the"
"1.2.1.17","12","appropriate sub-process capabilities with a particular sequence"
"1.2.1.17","13","and timing. An executive process (i.e., the exercise of an"
"1.2.1.17","14","executive capability) involves such sub-processes as planning,"
"1.2.1.17","15","selecting, and supervising, and it is really the executive"
"1.2.1.17","16","processes that embody all of the methodology in the H-LAM/T"
"1.2.1.17","17","system."
"1.2.1.18","1","To illustrate the capability-hierarchy features of our"
"1.2.1.18","2","conceptual framework, let us consider an artifact innovation"
"1.2.1.18","3","appearing directly within the relatively low-order capability"
"1.2.1.18","4","for composing and modifying written text, and see how this can"
"1.2.1.18","5","affect a (or, for instance, your) hierarchy of capabilities."
"1.2.1.18","6","Suppose you had a new writing machine--think of it as a high-"
"1.2.1.18","7","speed electric typewriter with some special features. You could"
"1.2.1.18","8","operate its keyboard to cause it to write text much as you could"
"1.2.1.18","9","use a conventional typewriter.  But the printing mechanism is"
"1.2.1.18","10","more complicated; besides printing a visible character at every"
"1.2.1.18","11","stroke, it adds special encoding features by means of invisible"
"1.2.1.18","12","selective components in the ink and special shaping of the"
"1.2.1.18","13","character."
"1.2.1.19","1","As an auxiliary device, there is a gadget that is held like a"
"1.2.1.19","2","pencil and, instead of a point, has a special sensing mechanism"
"1.2.1.19","3","that you can pass over a line of the special printing from your"
"1.2.1.19","4","writing machine (or one like it). The signals which this reading"
"1.2.1.19","5","stylus sends through the flexible connecting wire to the writing"
"1.2.1.19","6","machine are used to determine which characters are being sensed"
"1.2.1.19","7","and thus to cause the automatic typing of a duplicate string of"
"1.2.1.19","8","characters. An information-storage mechanism in the writing"
"1.2.1.19","9","machine permits you to sweep the reading stylus over the"
"1.2.1.19","10","characters much faster than the writer can type; the writer will"
"1.2.1.19","11","catch up with you when you stop to think about what word or"
"1.2.1.19","12","string of words should be duplicated next, or while you"
"1.2.1.19","13","reposition the straightedge guide along which you run the"
"1.2.1.19","14","stylus."
"1.2.1.20","1","This writing machine would permit you to use a new process of"
"1.2.1.20","2","composing text. For instance, trial drafts could rapidly be"
"1.2.1.20","3","composed from re-arranged excerpts of old drafts, together with"
"1.2.1.20","4","new words or passages which you stop to type in. Your first"
"1.2.1.20","5","draft could represent a free outpouring of thoughts in any"
"1.2.1.20","6","order, with the inspection of foregoing thoughts continuously"
"1.2.1.20","7","stimulating new considerations and ideas to be entered. If the"
"1.2.1.20","8","tangle of thoughts represented by the draft became too complex,"
"1.2.1.20","9","you would compile a reordered draft quickly. It would be"
"1.2.1.20","10","practical for you to accommodate more complexity in the trails"
"1.2.1.20","11","of thought you might build in search of the path that suits your"
"1.2.1.20","12","needs."
"1.2.1.21","1","You can integrate your new ideas more easily, and thus harness"
"1.2.1.21","2","your creativity more continuously, if you can quickly and"
"1.2.1.21","3","flexibly change your working record. If it is easier to update"
"1.2.1.21","4","any part of your working record to accommodate new developments"
"1.2.1.21","5","in thought or circumstance, you will find it easier to"
"1.2.1.21","6","incorporate more complex procedures in your way of doing things."
"1.2.1.21","7","This will probably allow you to accommodate the extra burden"
"1.2.1.21","8","associated with, for instance, keeping and using special files"
"1.2.1.21","9","whose contents are both contributed to and utilized by any"
"1.2.1.21","10","current work in a flexible manner--which in turn enables you to"
"1.2.1.21","11","devise and use even-more complex procedures to better harness"
"1.2.1.21","12","your talents in your particular working situation."
"1.2.1.22","1","The important thing to appreciate here is that a direct new"
"1.2.1.22","2","innovation in one particular capability can have far-reaching"
"1.2.1.22","3","effects throughout the rest of your capability hierarchy. A"
"1.2.1.22","4","change can propagate up through the capability hierarchy;"
"1.2.1.22","5","higher-order capabilities that can utilize the initially changed"
"1.2.1.22","6","capability can now reorganize to take special advantage of this"
"1.2.1.22","7","change and of the intermediate higher-capability changes. A"
"1.2.1.22","8","change can propagate <i>down</i> through the hierarchy as a"
"1.2.1.22","9","result of new capabilities at the high level and modification"
"1.2.1.22","10","possibilities latent in lower levels.  These latent capabilities"
"1.2.1.22","11","may previously have been unusable in the hierarchy and become"
"1.2.1.22","12","usable because of the new capability at the higher level."
"1.2.1.23","1","The writing machine and its flexible copying capability would"
"1.2.1.23","2","occupy you for a long time if you tried to exhaust the"
"1.2.1.23","3","reverberating chain of associated possibilities for making"
"1.2.1.23","4","useful innovations within your capability hierarchy. This one"
"1.2.1.23","5","innovation could trigger a rather extensive redesign of this"
"1.2.1.23","6","hierarchy; your way of accomplishing many of your tasks would"
"1.2.1.23","7","change considerably. Indeed this process characterizes the sort"
"1.2.1.23","8","of evolution that our intellect-augmentation means have been"
"1.2.1.23","9","undergoing since the first human brain appeared."
"1.2.1.24","1","To our objective of deriving orientation about possibilities for"
"1.2.1.24","2","actively pursuing an increase in human intellectual"
"1.2.1.24","3","effectiveness, it is important to realize that we must be"
"1.2.1.24","4","prepared to pursue such new- possibility chains throughout the"
"1.2.1.24","5","<i>entire</i> capability hierarchy (calling for a system"
"1.2.1.24","6","approach). It is also important to realize that we must be"
"1.2.1.24","7","oriented to the <i>synthesis</i> of new capabilities from"
"1.2.1.24","8","reorganization of other capabilities, both old and new, that"
"1.2.1.24","9","exist throughout the hierarchy (calling for a &quot;system-"
"1.2.1.24","10","engineering&quot; approach)."
"1.2.2","1","B. THE BASIC PERSPECTIVE"
"1.2.2.1","1","Individuals who operate effectively in our culture have already"
"1.2.2.1","2","been considerably &quot;augmented.&quot; Basic human"
"1.2.2.1","3","capabilities for sensing stimuli, performing numerous mental"
"1.2.2.1","4","operations, and for communicating with the outside world, are"
"1.2.2.1","5","put to work in our society within a system--an H-LAM/T system--"
"1.2.2.1","6","the individual augmented by the language, artifacts, and"
"1.2.2.1","7","methodology in which he is trained. Furthermore, we suspect that"
"1.2.2.1","8","improving the effectiveness of the individual as he operates in"
"1.2.2.1","9","our society should be approached as a system-engineering problem"
"1.2.2.1","10","--that is, the H-LAM/T system should be studied as an"
"1.2.2.1","11","interacting whole from a synthesis-oriented approach."
"1.2.2.2","1","This view of the system as an interacting whole is strongly"
"1.2.2.2","2","bolstered by considering the repertoire hierarchy of process"
"1.2.2.2","3","capabilities that is structured from the basic ingredients"
"1.2.2.2","4","within the H-LAM/T system. The realization that any potential"
"1.2.2.2","5","change in language, artifact, or methodology has importance only"
"1.2.2.2","6","relative to its use within a process' and that a new process"
"1.2.2.2","7","capability appearing anywhere within that hierarchy can make"
"1.2.2.2","8","practical a new consideration of latent change possibilities in"
"1.2.2.2","9","many other parts of the hierarchy--possibilities in either"
"1.2.2.2","10","language, artifacts, or methodology--brings out the strong"
"1.2.2.2","11","interrelationship of these three augmentation means."
"1.2.2.3","1","Increasing the effectiveness of the individual's use of his"
"1.2.2.3","2","basic capabilities is a problem in redesigning the changeable"
"1.2.2.3","3","parts of a system. The system is actively engaged in the"
"1.2.2.3","4","continuous processes (among others) of developing comprehension"
"1.2.2.3","5","within the individual and of solving problems; both processes"
"1.2.2.3","6","are subject to human motivation, purpose, and will. To redesign"
"1.2.2.3","7","the system's capability for performing these processes means"
"1.2.2.3","8","redesigning all or part of the repertoire hierarchy. To redesign"
"1.2.2.3","9","a structure, we must learn as much as we can of what is known"
"1.2.2.3","10","about the basic materials and components as they are utilized"
"1.2.2.3","11","within the structure; beyond that, we must learn how to view, to"
"1.2.2.3","12","measure, to analyze, and to evaluate in terms of the functional"
"1.2.2.3","13","whole and its purpose. In this particular case, no existing"
"1.2.2.3","14","analytic theory is by itself adequate for the purpose of"
"1.2.2.3","15","analyzing and evaluating over-all system performance; pursuit of"
"1.2.2.3","16","an improved system thus demands the use of <i>experimental</i>"
"1.2.2.3","17","methods."
"1.2.2.4","1","It need not bew just the very sophisticated or formal process"
"1.2.2.4","2","capabilities that are added or modified in this redesign."
"1.2.2.4","3","Essentially any of the processes utilized by a representative"
"1.2.2.4","4","human today--the processes that he thinks of when he looks ahead"
"1.2.2.4","5","to his day's work--are composite processes of the sort that"
"1.2.2.4","6","involve external composing and manipulating of symbols (text,"
"1.2.2.4","7","sketches, diagrams, lists, etc.). Many of the external composing"
"1.2.2.4","8","and manipulating (modifying, rearranging) processes serve such"
"1.2.2.4","9","characteristically &quot;human&quot; activities as playing with"
"1.2.2.4","10","forms and relationships to ask what develops, cut- and-try"
"1.2.2.4","11","multiple-pass development of an idea, or listing items to"
"1.2.2.4","12","reflect on and then rearranging and extending them as thoughts"
"1.2.2.4","13","develop."
"1.2.2.5","1","Existing, or near-future, technology could certainly provide our"
"1.2.2.5","2","professional problem-solvers with the artifacts they need to"
"1.2.2.5","3","have for duplicating and rearranging text before their eyes,"
"1.2.2.5","4","quickly and with a minimum of human effort. Even ao apparently"
"1.2.2.5","5","minor an advance could yield total changes in an individual's"
"1.2.2.5","6","repertoire hierarchy that would represent a great increase in"
"1.2.2.5","7","over-all effectivenesa. Normally the necessary equipment would"
"1.2.2.5","8","enter the market slowly; changes from the expected would be"
"1.2.2.5","9","small, people would change their ways of doing things a little"
"1.2.2.5","10","at a time, and only gradually would their accumulated changes"
"1.2.2.5","11","create markets for more radical versions of the equipment. Such"
"1.2.2.5","12","an evolutionary process has been typical of the way our"
"1.2.2.5","13","repertoire hierarchies have grown and formed."
"1.2.2.6","1","But an active research effort, aimed at exploring and evaluating"
"1.2.2.6","2","poasible integrated changes throughout the repertoire hierarchy,"
"1.2.2.6","3","could greatly accelerate this evolutionary process. The reaearch"
"1.2.2.6","4","effort could guide the product development of new artifacts"
"1.2.2.6","5","toward taking long-range meaningful steps; simultaneously"
"1.2.2.6","6","competitively minded individuals who would respond to"
"1.2.2.6","7","demonstrated methods for achieving greater personal"
"1.2.2.6","8","effectiveness would create a market for the more radical"
"1.2.2.6","9","equipment innovations. The guided evolutionary process could be"
"1.2.2.6","10","expected to be considerably more rapid than the traditional one."
"1.2.2.7","1","The category of &quot;more radical innovations&quot; includes"
"1.2.2.7","2","the digital computer as a tool for the personal use of an"
"1.2.2.7","3","individual. Here there is not only promise of great flexibility"
"1.2.2.7","4","in the composing and rearranging of text and diagrams before the"
"1.2.2.7","5","individual's eyes but also promise of many other process"
"1.2.2.7","6","capabilities that can be integrated into the H-LAM/T system's"
"1.2.2.7","7","repertoire hierarchy."
"1.2.3","1","C. DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE H-LAM/T SYSTEM"
"1.2.3.1","1","1. The Source of Intelligence"
"1.2.3.1.1","1","When one looks at a computer system   that is doing a very"
"1.2.3.1.1","2","complex job, he sees on the surface a   machine that can execute"
"1.2.3.1.1","3","some extremely sophisticated   processes. If he is a layman, his"
"1.2.3.1.1","4","concept of what provides   this sophisticated capability may"
"1.2.3.1.1","5","endow the machine with a   mysterious power to sweep information"
"1.2.3.1.1","6","through perceptive and   intelligent synthetic thinking devices."
"1.2.3.1.1","7","Actually, this   sophisticated capability results from a very"
"1.2.3.1.1","8","clever   organizational hierarchy so that pursuit of the source"
"1.2.3.1.1","9","of   intelligence within this system would take one down through"
"1.2.3.1.1","10","layers of functional and physical organization that become"
"1.2.3.1.1","11","successively more primitive."
"1.2.3.1.2","1","To be more specific, we can begin at   the top and list the"
"1.2.3.1.2","2","major levels down through which we would   pass if we"
"1.2.3.1.2","3","successively decomposed the functional elements of   each level"
"1.2.3.1.2","4","in search of the &quot;source of intelligence.&quot; A"
"1.2.3.1.2","5","programmer could take us down through perhaps three levels"
"1.2.3.1.2","6","(depending upon the sophistication of the total process being"
"1.2.3.1.2","7","executed by the computer) perhaps depicting the organization"
"1.2.3.1.2","8","at each level with a flow chart. The first level down would"
"1.2.3.1.2","9","organize functions corresponding to statements in a   problem-"
"1.2.3.1.2","10","oriented language (e.g., ALGOL or COBOL), to achieve   the"
"1.2.3.1.2","11","desired over-all process. The second level down would   organize"
"1.2.3.1.2","12","lesser functions into the processes represented by   first-level"
"1.2.3.1.2","13","statements. The third level would perhaps show how   the basic"
"1.2.3.1.2","14","machine commands (or rather the processes which they"
"1.2.3.1.2","15","represent) were organized to achieve each of the functions of"
"1.2.3.1.2","16","the second level."
"1.2.3.1.3","1","Then a machine designer could take   over, and with a block"
"1.2.3.1.3","2","diagram of the computer's organization   he could show us (Level"
"1.2.3.1.3","3","4) how the different hardware units   (e.g., random-access"
"1.2.3.1.3","4","storage, arithmetic registers, adder,   arithmetic control) are"
"1.2.3.1.3","5","organized to provide the capability of   executing sequences of"
"1.2.3.1.3","6","the commands used in Level 3. The logic   designer could then"
"1.2.3.1.3","7","give us a tour of Level 5, also using   block diagrams, to show"
"1.2.3.1.3","8","us how such hardware elements as pulse   gates, flip-flops' and"
"1.2.3.1.3","9","AND, OR, and NOT circuits can be   organized into networks"
"1.2.3.1.3","10","giving the functions utilized at Level   4.  For Level 6 a"
"1.2.3.1.3","11","circuit engineer could show us diagrams   revealing how"
"1.2.3.1.3","12","components such as transistors, resistors,   capacitors, and"
"1.2.3.1.3","13","diodes can be organized into modular networks   that provide the"
"1.2.3.1.3","14","functions needed for the elements of Level   5."
"1.2.3.1.4","1","Device engineers and physicists of   different kinds could take"
"1.2.3.1.4","2","us down through more layers. But   rather soon we have crossed"

"1.2.3.4.3","3","the evolution of language was   affected by the concepts the"
"1.2.3.4.3","4","people developed and   used. However, Korzybski <a"

"1.2.3.4.3","7","that the language we use affects our thinking to a"
"1.2.3.4.3","8","considerable extent. They say that a lack of words for some"
"1.2.3.4.3","9","types of concepts makes it hard to express those concepts, and"
"1.2.3.4.3","10","thus decreases the likelihood that we will learn much about"
"1.2.3.4.3","11","them. If this is so, then once a language has begun to grow"
"1.2.3.4.3","12","and be used, it would seem reasonable to suspect that the"
"1.2.3.4.3","13","language also affects the evolution of the new concepts to be"
"1.2.3.4.3","14","expressed in that language."
"1.2.3.4.4","1","Apparently there are counter-arguments   to this; e.g., if a"
"1.2.3.4.4","2","concept needs to be used often but its   expression is"
"1.2.3.4.4","3","difficult, then the language will evolve to ease   the"
"1.2.3.4.4","4","situation. However, the studies of the past decade into   what"
"1.2.3.4.4","5","are called &quot;self-organizing&quot; systems seem to be"
"1.2.3.4.4","6","revealing   that subtle relationships among its interacting"
"1.2.3.4.4","7","elements can   significantly influence the course of evolution"
"1.2.3.4.4","8","of such a   system. If this is true, and if language is (as it"

"1.2.3.4.4","10","probable   that the state of a language at a given time strongly"
"1.2.3.4.4","11","affects   its own evolution to a succeeding state."
"1.2.3.4.5","1","For our conceptual framework, we tend   to favor the view that a"

"1.2.3.4.5","3","that the shift over the last few   centuries in matters that are"
"1.2.3.4.5","4","of daily concern to the   individual has necessarily been forced"
"1.2.3.4.5","5","into the framework of   the language existing at the time, with"
"1.2.3.4.5","6","alterations generally   limited to new uses for old words, or"
"1.2.3.4.5","7","the coining of new   words. The English language since"

"1.2.3.5.1","2","capabilities that is structured in   the form of a hierarchy is"
"1.2.3.5.1","3","most useful in our study.  We shall   use it in the following to"

"1.2.3.5.1","6","repertoire hierarchies: the   materials with which we have to"
"1.2.3.5.1","7","work, and the principles by   which new capability is"
"1.2.3.5.1","8","constructed from these basic   materials."
"1.2.3.5.2","1","a. Basic Capabilities"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","1","<i>&quot;Materials&quot;</i> in this context     are those"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","2","capabilities in the human and in the artifact     domains from"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","3","which all other capabilities in the repertoire     hierarchy"

"1.2.3.5.2.1","5","type of functional component with which the     system can be"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","6","built, and a thorough job of redesigning the     system calls"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","7","for making an inventory of the basic     capabilities available."
"1.2.3.5.2.1","8","Because we are exploring for     perspective, and not yet"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","9","recommending research activities,     we are free to discuss and"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","10","define in more detail what we     mean by &quot;basic"
"1.2.3.5.2.1","11","capability&quot;, without regard to the amount of     research"

"1.2.3.5.2.2","6","class (those in use) can be     found in a methodical manner by"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","7","analyzing present capability     hierarchies. For example,"

"1.2.3.5.2.2","12","decomposed into     an eventual set of basic capabilities. As"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","13","you proceed down     through the hierarchy, you will begin to"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","14","encounter     capabilities that cannot be usefully changed, and"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","15","these will     make up your inventory of basic capabilities."
"1.2.3.5.2.2","16","Ultimately,     every such recursive decomposition of a given"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","17","capability in     the hierarchy will find every one of its"

"1.2.3.5.2.2","19","such     decomposition search with different capabilities in the"

"1.2.3.5.2.2","22","system. Many of the branching paths in the decomposition of"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","23","a given higher-order capability will terminate in the same"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","24","basic capability, since a given basic capability will often"
"1.2.3.5.2.2","25","be used within many different higher-order capabilities."
"1.2.3.5.2.3","1","Determining the class of basic     capabilities not already"

"1.2.3.5.2.4","4","serious consideration. For instance,     some research"

"1.2.3.5.2.5","1","The capability for performing a     certain finger action, for"

"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","5","of exchange.&quot; We view a concept as a       tool that can be"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","6","grasped and used by the mental       mechanisms, that can be"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","7","composed, interpreted, and used by       the natural mental"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","8","substances and processes. The grasping       and handling done"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","9","by these mechanisms can often be       facilitated if the"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","10","concept is given an explicit &quot;handle&quot;       in the"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","11","form of a representative symbol.  Somehow the       mental"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","12","mechanisms can learn to manipulate images (or       something)"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","13","of symbols in a meaningful way and remain       calmly confident"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.1","14","that the associated conceptual       manipulations are within"

"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","1","Concepts seem to be       structurable, in that a new concept"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","2","can be composed of an       organization of established"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","3","concepts. For present       purposes, we can view a <i>concept"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","4","structure</i> as       something which we might try to develop"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","5","on paper for       ourselves or work with by conscious thought"

"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","13","&quot;comprehending&quot;       behavior. Our working assumption"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","14","also considers that some       concept structures would be"
"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","15","better for this purpose than       others, in that they would be"

"1.2.3.5.3.3.2","17","structures, or in that the       resulting mental structures"

"1.2.3.5.3.3.3","1","A concept structure often grows       as part of a cultural"

"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","1","The other important part of our       &quot;language&quot; is"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","2","the way in which concepts are       represented--the symbols and"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","3","<i>symbol structures</i>. Words structured into phrases,"

"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","5","diagrams, tables,       etc. A given structure of concepts can"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","6","be represented by       any of an infinite number of different"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","7","symbol structures,       some of which would be much better than"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","8","others for       enabling the human perceptual and cognitive"

"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","10","matter of       significance and/or interest to the human. For"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","11","instance, a       concept structure involving many numerical"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","12","data would       generally be much better represented with"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","13","Arabic rather       than Roman numerals and quite likely a"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","14","graphic structure       would be better than a tabular"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.1","15","structure."
"1.2.3.5.3.4.2","1","But it is not only the <i>form</i> of a symbol structure that is"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.2","2","important.  A problem       solver is involved in a stream of"

"1.2.3.5.3.4.2","4","of the moment. The       sequence and nature of these needs are"
"1.2.3.5.3.4.2","5","quite variable, and       yet for each need he may benefit"

"1.2.3.5.3.4.4","2","as a pattern of marks on       a sheet of paper. When we want a"

"1.2.3.5.3.5.1","9","structuring."
"1.2.3.5.3.5.2","1","As we are currently using it,       the term includes the"
"1.2.3.5.3.5.2","2","organization, study, modification,       and execution of"
"1.2.3.5.3.5.2","3","processes and process structures. Whereas       concept"
"1.2.3.5.3.5.2","4","structuring and symbol structuring together       represent the"

"1.2.3.5.3.5.3","1","Many of the process structures       are applied to the task of"
"1.2.3.5.3.5.3","2","organizing, executing,       supervising, and evaluating other"
"1.2.3.5.3.5.3","3","process structures. Many       of them are applied to the"

"1.2.3.5.3.6.1","4","component of our       augmentation means, insofar as their"
"1.2.3.5.3.6.1","5","actual physical       construction is concerned."
"1.2.3.5.3.7","1","7) Interdependence and       Regeneration"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","1","A very important feature to be       noted from the discussion"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","2","in this section bears upon the       interdependence among the"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","3","various types of structuring       which are involved in the"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","4","H-LAM/T system, where the       capability for doing each type"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","5","of structuring is dependent       upon the capability for doing"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","6","one or more of the other       types of structuring. (Assuming"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","7","that the physical       structuring of the system remains"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","8","basically unchanged       during the system's operation, we"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","9","exclude its dependence       upon other factors in this"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.1","10","discussion.)"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","1","This interdependence actually       has a cyclic, regenerative"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","2","nature to it which is very       significant to us. We have seen"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","3","how the capability for       mental structuring is finally"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","4","dependent, down the chain,       upon the process structuring"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","5","(human, artifact, composite)       that enables symbol-structure"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","6","manipulation.  But it also       is evident that the process"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","7","structuring is dependent not       only upon basic human and"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","8","artifact process capabilities,       but upon the ability of the"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","9","human to learn how to execute       processes--and no less"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","10","important, upon the ability of the       human to select,"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","11","organize, and modify processes from his       repertoire to"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","12","structure a higher-order process that he can       execute."
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","13","Thus, a capability for structuring and executing       processes"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","14","is partially dependent upon the human's mental"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","15","structuring, which in turn is partially dependent upon his"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","16","process structuring (through concept and symbol"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","17","structuring), which is partially dependent upon his mental"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.2","18","structuring, etc."
"1.2.3.5.3.7.3","1","All of this means that a       significant improvement in"

"1.2.3.5.3.7.3","3","structuring (initially perhaps       through much better"
"1.2.3.5.3.7.3","4","artifacts) should enable us to develop       improvements in"

"1.2.3.5.3.7.3","6","turn enable us to organize and execute       symbol-manipulation"

"1.2.3.5.4.1","1","In the repertoire hierarchy of     capabilities possessed by the"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","2","H-LAM/T system, the human     contributes many types of"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","3","capability that represent a wide     variety of roles. At one"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","4","time or another he will be the     policy maker, the goal"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","5","setter, the performance supervisor,     the work scheduler, the"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","6","professional specialist, the clerk,     the janitor, the"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","7","entrepreneur, and the proprietor (or at     least a major"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","8","stockholder) of the system. In the midst of     some complex"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","9","process, in fact, he may well be playing     several roles"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","10","concurrently--or at least have the     responsibility of the"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","11","roles. For instance, usually he must     be aware of his"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","12","progress toward a goal (supervisor), he must     be alert to the"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","13","possibilities for changing the goal (policy     maker, planner),"
"1.2.3.5.4.1","14","and he must keep records for these and     other roles (clerk)."
"1.2.3.5.4.2","1","Consider a given capability (Capability 1) at some level in the"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","2","repertoire hierarchy. There seems to be a sort of standard"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","3","grouping of     lower-order capabilities from which this is"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","4","composed, and     these exist in two classes--what we might call"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","5","the <i>executive</i> class and what we might call the <i>direct-"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","6","contributive</i> class. In the executive class of"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","7","capabilities we find those used for comprehending, planning,"

"1.2.3.5.4.2","9","the direct-contributive class we find the capabilities"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","10","organized by the executive class toward the direct"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","11","realization of Capability 1. For example, when my telephone"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","12","rings, I execute the direct-contributive processes of"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","13","picking up the receiver and saying hello. It was the"

"1.2.3.5.4.2","16","be picked up and, when the receiver was in place (first"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","17","process accomplished), directed the next process, the saying"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","18","hello. That represents the composition of my capability for"
"1.2.3.5.4.2","19","answering the phone."
"1.2.3.5.4.3","1","For a low-level capability, such     as that of writing a word"
"1.2.3.5.4.3","2","with a pencil, both the executive     and the direct-"
"1.2.3.5.4.3","3","contributive subprocesses during actual     execution would be"
"1.2.3.5.4.3","4","automatic. This type of automatic     capability need only be"
"1.2.3.5.4.3","5","summoned by a higher executive     process in order for trained"

"1.2.3.5.4.4","1","At a little higher level of     capability, more of the"
"1.2.3.5.4.4","2","conscious conceptual and executive     capabilities become"
"1.2.3.5.4.4","3","involved. To call someone on the     telephone, I must"
"1.2.3.5.4.4","4","consciously comprehend the need for this     process and how I"
"1.2.3.5.4.4","5","can execute it, I must consciously pick up     the directory and"
"1.2.3.5.4.4","6","search for the name and telephone number,     and I must"
"1.2.3.5.4.4","7","consciously direct the dialing of the number."
"1.2.3.5.4.5","1","At a still higher level of     capability, the executive"
"1.2.3.5.4.5","2","capabilities must have a degree of     power that unaided mental"
"1.2.3.5.4.5","3","capabilities cannot provide.  In     such a case, one might make"
"1.2.3.5.4.5","4","a list of steps and check each     item off as it is executed."

"1.2.3.5.4.5","8","labor and a very complex     organization of the system's"
"1.2.3.5.4.5","9","capabilities."
"1.2.3.5.4.6","1","Imagining a process as complex as     the last example brings us"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","2","to the realization that at any     particular moment the H-LAM/T"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","3","system may be in the middle of     executing a great number of"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","4","processes. Assume that the human     is in the middle of the"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","5","process of making a telephone     call. That telephone call is a"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","6","subprocess in the middle of     the process of calling a"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","7","committee meeting. But calling a     committee meeting is a"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","8","subprocess in the middle of the     process of determining a"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","9","budgetary policy, which is in turn     but a subprocess in the"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","10","middle of the process of estimating     manpower needs, and so"
"1.2.3.5.4.6","11","on."
"1.2.3.5.4.7","1","Not only does the human need to     play various roles"
"1.2.3.5.4.7","2","(sometimes concurrently) in the execution     of any given"
"1.2.3.5.4.7","3","process, but he is playing these roles for the     many"
"1.2.3.5.4.7","4","concurrent processes that are being executed at     different"
"1.2.3.5.4.7","5","levels.  This situation is typical for any of us     engaged in"
"1.2.3.5.4.7","6","reasonably demanding types of professional     pursuits, and yet"

"1.2.3.5.4.7","10","explicit and effective concepts, terms,     equipment, and"
"1.2.3.5.4.7","11","methods for all these roles, and for their     dynamic"

"1.2.3.5.5.1","1","It is the repertoire hierarchy of     process capabilities upon"

"1.2.3.5.5.1","3","This repertoire hierarchy is     rather like a mountain of"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","4","white-collar talent that sits atop     and controls the talents"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","5","of the workers. We can illustrate     this executive"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","6","superstructure by considering it as though it     were a network"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","7","of contractors and subcontractors in which     each capability"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","8","in the repertoire hierarchy is represented     by an independent"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","9","contractor whose mode of operation is to     do the planning,"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","10","make up specifications, subcontract the     actual work, and"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","11","supervise the performance of his     subcontractors. This means"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","12","that each subcontractor does the     same thing in his turn. At"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","13","the bottom of this hierarchy are     those independent"
"1.2.3.5.5.1","14","contractors who do actual &quot;production     work.&quot;"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","1","If by some magical process the     production workers could"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","2","still know just what to do and when     to do it even though the"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","3","superstructure of contractors was     removed from above them,"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","4","no one would know the     difference. The executive"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","5","superstructure is necessary     because humans do not operate by"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","6","magic, but even a necessary     superstructure is a burden. We"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","7","can readily recognize that     there are many ways to organize"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","8","and manage such a     superstructure, resulting in vastly"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","9","different degrees of     efficiency in the application of the"
"1.2.3.5.5.2","10","workers' talents."
"1.2.3.5.5.3","1","Suppose that the activity of the     production workers was of"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","2","the same nature as the activity of     the different"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","3","contractors, and that this activity consisted     of gaining"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","4","comprehension and solving problems. And suppose     that there"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","5","was only so much applicable talent available to     the total"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","6","system.  The question now becomes how to     distribute that"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","7","talent between superstructure and workers to     get the most"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","8","total production. The efficiency of     organization within the"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","9","superstructure is now doubly     important so that a minimum of"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","10","talent in the superstructure     produces a maximum of"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","11","organizational efficiency in directing     the productivity of"
"1.2.3.5.5.3","12","the remaining talent."
"1.2.3.5.5.4","1","In the situation where talent is     limited, we find a close"
"1.2.3.5.5.4","2","parallel to our H-LAM/T system in     its pursuit of"

"1.2.3.5.5.5","8","within the     superstructure--each contractor involved in the"

"1.2.3.5.5.5","11","to the     changes by restudying the situation, changing his"
"1.2.3.5.5.5","12","plans,     changing the specifications to his subcontractors,"

"1.2.3.5.7.3","4","today, artifacts are involved     explicitly in only the lower-"

"1.2.3.5.7.3","6","should be possible to have     computer processes provide direct"
"1.2.3.5.7.3","7","and significant help in     his processes at many levels. We"
"1.2.3.5.7.3","8","thus expect the effect of     the computer in the system to be"
"1.2.3.5.7.3","9","very much compounded. A     great deal of richness in the future"
"1.2.3.5.7.3","10","possibilities for     automated H-LAM/T systems is implied here"
"1.2.3.5.7.3","11","--considerably more     than many people realize who would"

"1.2.3.5.7.3","13","do now. This type of     compounding is related to the"
"1.2.3.5.7.3","14","reverberating waves of change     discussed in Section II-A."

"1.3","1","III. EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION"
"1.3.1","1","A. BACKGROUND"
"1.3.1.1","1","The conceptual structure which we have evolved to orient and"
"1.3.1.1","2","guide the pursuit of increasing man's intellectual effectiveness"
"1.3.1.1","3","has been des cribed in the foregoing sections in a rather"
"1.3.1.1","4","general and abstract fashion. In this section we shall try to"
"1.3.1.1","5","develop more concrete images of these concepts, of some of the"
"1.3.1.1","6","future possibilities for augmentation, and of the relationship"
"1.3.1.1","7","between these different concepts and possibilities."
"1.3.1.2","1","It must be borne in mind that a great deal of study and"
"1.3.1.2","2","invention is yet to be done in developing the improved"
"1.3.1.2","3","augmentation means that are bound to come, and that the examples"
"1.3.1.2","4","which we present in this report are intended only to show what"
"1.3.1.2","5","is meant by the generalizations which we use, and to provide a"
"1.3.1.2","6","feeling on the part of the reader for the richness and power of"
"1.3.1.2","7","the improvements we can likely develop in our augmentation"
"1.3.1.2","8","means. Many of the examples are realizable today (in fact, some"
"1.3.1.2","9","have been realized) and most of the rest are reasonably straight"
"1.3.1.2","10","forward extrapolations into the near future. We predict that"
"1.3.1.2","11","what actually develops in the new augmentation means will be"
"1.3.1.2","12","consistent with our conceptual framework, but that the"
"1.3.1.2","13","particulars will be full of surprises."
"1.3.1.3","1","Each of the examples will show a facet of how the little steps"
"1.3.1.3","2","that the human can take with his sensory-mental-motor apparatus"
"1.3.1.3","3","can be organized cooperatively with the capabilities of"
"1.3.1.3","4","artifacts to accomplish significant things in the way of"
"1.3.1.3","5","achieving comprehension and solving problems. This organization,"
"1.3.1.3","6","as we have shown in Section II, can be viewed as the five"
"1.3.1.3","7","different types of structuring which we outlined, where much of"
"1.3.1.3","8","the structuring that goes on in the human's total problem"
"1.3.1.3","9","solving activity is for the purpose of building a mental"
"1.3.1.3","10","structure which in a way &quot;puts the human up where he can"
"1.3.1.3","11","see what is going on and can point the direction to move"
"1.3.1.3","12","next.&quot;"
"1.3.1.4","1","An early paper, offering suggestions toward augmenting the human"
"1.3.1.4","2","intellect, that fits well and significantly within the framework"
"1.3.1.4","3","which we have developed was written by Vannevar Bush <a"
"1.3.1.4","4","href=&quot;#Ref-6&quot;>(6)</a> in 1945. Indeed, it fits so"
"1.3.1.4","5","well, and states its points so nicely, thst it was deemed"
"1.3.1.4","6","appropriate to our purpose here to summarize it in detail and to"
"1.3.1.4","7","quote from it at considerable length."
"1.3.1.5","1","1. What Vannevar Bush proposed in   1945"
"1.3.1.5.1","1","He wrote as World War II was coming   to an end, and his"
"1.3.1.5.1","2","principal purpose seemed to be to offer new   professional"
"1.3.1.5.1","3","objectives to those scientists who were soon to   be freed from"
"1.3.1.5.1","4","war-motivated research and development. It would   seem that he"
"1.3.1.5.1","5","also wished to induce a general recognition of a   growing"
"1.3.1.5.1","6","problem--storage, retrieval, and manipulation of   information"
"1.3.1.5.1","7","for and by intellectual workers--and to show the   possibilities"
"1.3.1.5.1","8","he foresaw for scientific development of   equipment which could"
"1.3.1.5.1","9","significantly aid such workers in facing   this problem. He"
"1.3.1.5.1","10","summarized the situation: &quot;...There is a   growing mountain"
"1.3.1.5.1","11","of research...The investigator is staggered   by the findings"
"1.3.1.5.1","12","and conclusions of thousands of other workers.   Professionally"
"1.3.1.5.1","13","our methods of transmitting and reviewing the   results of"
"1.3.1.5.1","14","research are generations old...truly significant   attainments"
"1.3.1.5.1","15","become lost in the mass of the   inconsequential...The summation"
"1.3.1.5.1","16","of human experience is being   expanded at a prodigious rate,"
"1.3.1.5.1","17","and the means we use for   threading through the consequent maze"
"1.3.1.5.1","18","to the momentarily   important item is the same as was used in"
"1.3.1.5.1","19","the days of   square-rigged ships.&quot;"
"1.3.1.5.2","1","Then he brought out some general   considerations for hope:"
"1.3.1.5.2","2","&quot;.. But there are signs of a change   as new and powerful"
"1.3.1.5.2","3","instrumentalities come into   use...Photocells...advanced"
"1.3.1.5.2","4","photography...thermionic   tubes... cathode ray tubes...relay"
"1.3.1.5.2","5","combinations...there are   plenty of mechanical aids with which"
"1.3.1.5.2","6","to effect a   transformation in scientific records.&quot; And he"
"1.3.1.5.2","7","points out that   devices which we commonly use today--e.g., a"
"1.3.1.5.2","8","calculating   machine or an automobile--would have been"
"1.3.1.5.2","9","impossibly expensive   to produce in earlier eras of our"
"1.3.1.5.2","10","technological   development. &quot;...The world has arrived at"
"1.3.1.5.2","11","an age of cheap   complex devices of great reliability and"
"1.3.1.5.2","12","something is bound to   come of it.&quot;"
"1.3.1.5.3","1","In six and a half pages crammed full   of well-based"
"1.3.1.5.3","2","speculations, Bush proceeds to outline enough   plausible"
"1.3.1.5.3","3","artifact and methodology developments to make a very"
"1.3.1.5.3","4","convincing case for the augmentation of the individual"
"1.3.1.5.3","5","intellectual worker. Extension of existing photographic"
"1.3.1.5.3","6","techniques to give each individual a continuously available"
"1.3.1.5.3","7","miniature camera for recording anything in view and of"
"1.3.1.5.3","8","interest, and to realize a high-quality 100:1 linear reduction"
"1.3.1.5.3","9","ratio for micro-record files for these photographs and"
"1.3.1.5.3","10","published material; voice-recognition equipment (perhaps"
"1.3.1.5.3","11","requiring a special language) to ease the process of entering"
"1.3.1.5.3","12","new self-generated material into the written record--these are"
"1.3.1.5.3","13","to provide the individual with information-generating aid."
"1.3.1.5.4","1","For the detailed manipulation of   mathematical and logical"
"1.3.1.5.4","2","expressions, Bush projects computing   aids (which have been"
"1.3.1.5.4","3","surpassed by subsequent development)   that allow the individual"
"1.3.1.5.4","4","to exercise a greater proportion of   his time and talents in"
"1.3.1.5.4","5","the tasks of selecting data and the   appropriate"
"1.3.1.5.4","6","transformations and processes which are to be   executed,"
"1.3.1.5.4","7","leaving to the machinery the subsequent   execution. He suggests"
"1.3.1.5.4","8","that new notation for our verbal   symbols (perhaps binary)"
"1.3.1.5.4","9","could allow character recognition   devices to help even further"
"1.3.1.5.4","10","in the information-manipulation   area, and also points out that"
"1.3.1.5.4","11","poor symbolism (&quot;...the   exceedingly crude way in which"
"1.3.1.5.4","12","mathematicians express their   relationships. They employ a"
"1.3.1.5.4","13","symbolism which grew like Topsy   and has little consistency; a"
"1.3.1.5.4","14","strange fact in that most   logical field.&quot;) stands in the"
"1.3.1.5.4","15","way of full realization of   machine help for the manipulations"
"1.3.1.5.4","16","associated with the human's   real time process of mathematical"
"1.3.1.5.4","17","work. And &quot;...Then, on   beyond the strict logic of the"
"1.3.1.5.4","18","mathematician, lies the   application of logic in everyday"
"1.3.1.5.4","19","affairs. We may some day   click off arguments on a machine with"
"1.3.1.5.4","20","the same assurance that   we now enter sales on a cash"
"1.3.1.5.4","21","register.&quot;"
"1.3.1.5.5","1","Then &quot; ..So much for the manipulation   of ideas and their"
"1.3.1.5.5","2","insertion into the record. Thus far we seem   to be worse off"
"1.3.1.5.5","3","than before--for we can enormously extend the   record; yet even"
"1.3.1.5.5","4","in its present bulk we can hardly consult   it. This is a much"
"1.3.1.5.5","5","larger matter than merely the extraction of   data for the"
"1.3.1.5.5","6","purposes of scientific research; it involves the   entire"
"1.3.1.5.5","7","process by which man profits by his inheritance of   acquired"
"1.3.1.5.5","8","knowledge The prime action of use is selection, and   here we"
"1.3.1.5.5","9","are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine   thoughts,"
"1.3.1.5.5","10","and the account of the experience on which they are   based, all"
"1.3.1.5.5","11","encased within stone walls of acceptable   architectural form;"
"1.3.1.5.5","12","but if the scholar can get at only one a   week by diligent"
"1.3.1.5.5","13","search, his syntheses are not likely to keep   up with the"
"1.3.1.5.5","14","current scene.&quot; He goes on to discuss possible"
"1.3.1.5.5","15","developments that could allow very rapid (in the human's time"
"1.3.1.5.5","16","frame) selection of unit records from a very large file--where"
"1.3.1.5.5","17","the records could be dry-process photographic micro-images"
"1.3.1.5.5","18","upon which the user could add lnformation at will."
"1.3.1.5.6","1","Bush goes on to say, &quot;The real heart   of the matter of"
"1.3.1.5.6","2","selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in   the adoption of"
"1.3.1.5.6","3","mechanisms...Our ineptitude in getting at the   record is"
"1.3.1.5.6","4","largely caused by the artificiality of systems of"
"1.3.1.5.6","5","indexing.&quot; He observes the power of the associative recall"
"1.3.1.5.6","6","which human memory exhibits, and proposes that a mechanization"
"1.3.1.5.6","7","of selection by association could be realized to considerable"
"1.3.1.5.6","8","advantage. He spends the last two pages (a quarter of his"
"1.3.1.5.6","9","article) describing a device embodying this capability, and"
"1.3.1.5.6","10","points out some features of its use and of its likely   effect."
"1.3.1.5.6","11","This material is so relevant and so well put that I   quote it"
"1.3.1.5.6","12","in its entirety:"
"1.3.1.5.7","1",""
"1.3.1.5.7.1","1","&quot;Consider a future device for     individual use, which is"
"1.3.1.5.7.1","2","a sort of mechanized private file     and library. It needs a"
"1.3.1.5.7.1","3","name, and to coin one at random,     &quot;memex&quot; will do."
"1.3.1.5.7.1","4","A memex is a device in which an individual     stores all his"
"1.3.1.5.7.1","5","books, records, and communications, and which     is mechanized"
"1.3.1.5.7.1","6","so that it may be consulted with exceeding     speed and"
"1.3.1.5.7.1","7","flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement     to his"
"1.3.1.5.7.1","8","memory."
"1.3.1.5.7.2","1","&quot;It consists of a desk, and while     it can presumably be"
"1.3.1.5.7.2","2","operated from a distance, it is     primarily the piece of"
"1.3.1.5.7.2","3","furniture at which he works.  On the     top are slanting"
"1.3.1.5.7.2","4","translucent screens, on which material can     be projected for"
"1.3.1.5.7.2","5","convenient reading. There is a keyboard,     and sets of buttons"
"1.3.1.5.7.2","6","and levers.  Otherwise it looks like an     ordinary desk."
"1.3.1.5.7.3","1","&quot;In one end is the stored     material. The matter of bulk"
"1.3.1.5.7.3","2","is well taken care of by     improved microfilm. Only a small"
"1.3.1.5.7.3","3","part of the interior of the     memex is devoted to storage, the"
"1.3.1.5.7.3","4","rest to mechanism. Yet if     the user inserted 5000 pages of"
"1.3.1.5.7.3","5","material a day it would take     him hundreds of years to fill"
"1.3.1.5.7.3","6","the repository, so he can be     profligate and enter material"
"1.3.1.5.7.3","7","freely."
"1.3.1.5.7.4","1","&quot;Most of the memex contents are     purchased on microfilm"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","2","ready for insertion. Books of all     sorts, pictures, current"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","3","periodicals, newspapers, are thus     obtained and dropped into"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","4","place. Business correspondence     takes the same path. And"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","5","there is provision for direct     entry. On the top of the memex"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","6","is a transparent platen. On     this are placed longhand notes,"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","7","photographs, memoranda, all     sort of things. When one is in"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","8","place, the depression of a     lever causes it to be"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","9","photographed onto the next blank space     in a section of the"
"1.3.1.5.7.4","10","memex film, dry photography being     employed."
"1.3.1.5.7.5","1","&quot;There is, of course, provision     for consultation of the"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","2","record by the usual scheme of     indexing. If the user wishes"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","3","to consult a certain book, he     taps its code on the keyboard,"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","4","and the title page of the     book promptly appears before him,"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","5","projected onto one of his     viewing positions.  Frequently-"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","6","used codes are mnemonic, so     that he seldom consults his code"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","7","book; but when he does, a     single tap of a key projects it"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","8","for his use.  Moreover, he     has supplemental levers. On"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","9","deflecting one of these levers     to the right he runs through"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","10","the book before him, each page     in turn being projected at a"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","11","speed which just allows a     recognizing glance at each. If he"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","12","deflects it further to the     right, he steps through the book"
"1.3.1.5.7.5","13","10 pages at a time; still     further at 100 pages at a time."
"1.3.1.5.7.5","14","Deflection to the left gives     him the same control backwards."
"1.3.1.5.7.6","1","&quot;A special button transfers him     immediately to the"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","2","first page of the index. Any given book     of his library can"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","3","thus be called up and consulted with far     greater facility"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","4","than if it were taken from a shelf. As he     has several"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","5","projection positions, he can leave one item in     position"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","6","while he calls up another. He can add marginal     notes and"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","7","comments, taking advantage of one possible type of     dry"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","8","photography, and it could even be arranged so that he     can do"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","9","this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in     the"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","10","telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as     though"
"1.3.1.5.7.6","11","he had the physical page before him."
"1.3.1.5.7.7","1","&quot;All this is conventional, except     for the projection"
"1.3.1.5.7.7","2","forward of present-day mechanisms and     gadgetry. If affords"
"1.3.1.5.7.7","3","an immediate step, however, to     associative indexing, the"
"1.3.1.5.7.7","4","basic idea of which is a provision     whereby any item may be"
"1.3.1.5.7.7","5","caused at will to select immediately     and automatically"
"1.3.1.5.7.7","6","another. This is the essential feature of     the memex. The"
"1.3.1.5.7.7","7","process of tying two items together is the     important thing."
"1.3.1.5.7.8","1","&quot;When the user is building a     trail, he names it,"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","2","inserts the name in his code book, and     taps it out on his"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","3","keyboard. Before him are the two items to     be joined,"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","4","projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the     bottom of"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","5","each there are a number of blank code spaces, and     a pointer"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","6","is set to indicate one of these on each item. The     user taps"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","7","a single key, and the items are permanently     joined. In each"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","8","code space appears the code word.  Out of     view, but also in"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","9","the code space, is inserted a set of dots     for photocell"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","10","viewing; and on each item these dots by their     positions"
"1.3.1.5.7.8","11","designate the index number of the other item."
"1.3.1.5.7.9","1","&quot;Thereafter, at any time, when one     of these items is in"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","2","view, the other can be instantly     recalled merely by tapping"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","3","a button below the corresponding     code space. Moreover, when"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","4","numerous items have been thus     joined together to form a"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","5","trail, they can be reviewed in     turn, rapidly or slowly, by"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","6","deflecting a lever like that     used for turning the pages of a"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","7","book. It is exactly as     though the physical items had been"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","8","gathered together to form     a new book.  It is more than this,"
"1.3.1.5.7.9","9","for any item can be     joined into numerous trails."
"1.3.1.5.7.10","1","&quot;The owner of the memex, let us     say, is interested in"
"1.3.1.5.7.10","2","the origin and properties of the bow     and arrow. Specifically"
"1.3.1.5.7.10","3","he is studying why the short Turkish     bow was apparently"
"1.3.1.5.7.10","4","superior to the English long bow in the     skirmishes of the"
"1.3.1.5.7.10","5","Crusades. He has dozens of possibly     pertinent books and"
"1.3.1.5.7.10","6","articles in his memex. First he runs     through an"
"1.3.1.5.7.10","7","encyclopedia, finds and interesting but sketchy     article,"

"1.3.1.6.1","6","capsbility in symbol structuring   that derives from new"
"1.3.1.6.1","7","artifact-process capability, and that   provides new ways to"

"1.3.1.7.2.3","20","source serial number that     is at the top of the notecard--it"
"1.3.1.7.2.3","21","is a straight forward     clerical job for a secretary later to"

"1.3.1.7.3","1","b. Comments on the System"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","1","First, let me relate what has been     described to the special"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","2","terms brought out in previous     sections. The writing"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","3","contained on each notecard is a     small-sized symbol"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","4","structure, representing or portraying to     me a small"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","5","structure of concepts. The notches on the edges     of the cards"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","6","are symbols that serve to tie these card-sized     symbol sub"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","7","structures into a large symbol structure (the     notedeck). One"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","8","aspect of the structure is the physical     grouping of the"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","9","cards at a given time-- which happens to be     the only aspect"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","10","of the over-all structuring that my human     capabilities can"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","11","make direct use of--and in this respect I     can execute"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","12","processes which produce restructuring (that is,     physical re"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","13","grouping) that helps me considerably to perceive     and"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","14","assimilate the concepts of worth to me. This     restructuring"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","15","is effected by composite processes involving     me, a master"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","16","code card, a sorting needle, and a work     surface. I can add"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","17","to the symbol structure by executing     other composite"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","18","processes which involve me, writing     instruments (pen,"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","19","pencil, or type writer), a master code     card, and a card"
"1.3.1.7.3.1","20","notcher."
"1.3.1.7.3.2","1","If my mental processes were more     powerful, I could dispense"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","2","with the cards, and hold all of     the card-sized concept"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","3","structures in my memory, where also     would be held the"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","4","categorization linkages that evolved as I     worked (with my"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","5","feet up on the artifacts and my eyes     closed). As it is, and"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","6","as it probably always will be no     matter how we develop or"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","7","train our mental capabilities, I     want to work in problem"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","8","areas where the number and     interrelationship complexity of"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","9","the individual factors     involved are too much for me to hold"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","10","and manipulate within     my mind. So, my mind develops"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","11","conscious sets of concepts, or     recognizes and selects them"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","12","from what it perceives in the     work of others, and it directs"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","13","the organization of an     external symbol structure in which"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","14","can be held and portrayed     to the mind those concepts I"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","15","cannot (reliably) remember or     whose manipulations I cannot"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","16","visualize. The price I pay for     this augmentation shows up in"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","17","the time and energy involved     in manipulating artifacts to"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","18","manipulate symbols to give me     this artificial memory and"
"1.3.1.7.3.2","19","visualization of concepts and     their manipulation."
"1.3.1.7.4","1","c. Associative-Linking     Possibilities"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","1","But let us go further with     discussing specific examples of"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","2","means for augmenting our     intellects. In using the edge-"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","3","notched-card system described,     I found several types of"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","4","structuring which that system could     not provide, but which"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","5","would both be very useful and     probably ob tainable with"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","6","reasonably practical artifact     means. One need arose quite"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","7","commonly as trains of thought     would develop on a growing"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","8","series of note cards. There was     no convenient way to link"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","9","these cards together so that the     train of thought could"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","10","later be recalled by extracting the     ordered series of"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","11","notecards. An associative-trail scheme     similar to that out"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","12","lined by Bush for his Memex could     conceivably be implemented"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","13","with these cards to meet this     need and add a valuable new"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","14","symbol-structuring process to     the system. Straightforward"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","15","engineering development could     provide a mechanism that would"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","16","be able to select a specific     card from a relatively large"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","17","deck by a parallel edge-notch     sort on a unique serial number"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","18","notched into each card, and     the search mechanism could be"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","19","set up automatically by a hole     sensing mechanism from"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","20","internal punches on another card that     was placed in the"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","21","sensing slot. An auxiliary notching     mechanism could"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","22","automatically give succeeding serial-number     encoding to new"
"1.3.1.7.4.1","23","notecards as they are made up."
"1.3.1.7.4.2","1","Suppose that one wants to link     Card B to Card A, to make a"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","2","trail from A to B. He puts Card     B into a slot so that the"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","3","edge-notched coding of the card's     serial number can"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","4","automatically be sensed, and slips Card A     under a hole-"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","5","punching head which duplicates the     serial-number code of"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","6","Card B in the coding of the holes     punched in a speciflc zone"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","7","on Card A. Later, when he may     have discovered Card A, and"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","8","wishes to follow this particular     associative trail to the"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","9","next card, he aligns that zone on     Card A under a hole-"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","10","sensing head which reads the serial     number for Card B"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","11","therein and automatically sets up the     sorting mechanism. A"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","12","very quick and simple human process     thus initiates the"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","13","automatic extraction of the next item on     the associative"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","14","trail. It's not unreasonable to assume that     establishing a"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","15","link would take about three seconds, and     tracing a link to"
"1.3.1.7.4.2","16","the next card about three to five     seconds."
"1.3.1.7.4.3","1","There would still be     descriptor-code notching and selection"
"1.3.1.7.4.3","2","to provide for     general grouping classifications--and we can"
"1.3.1.7.4.3","3","see that the     system could really provide a means for"
"1.3.1.7.4.3","4","<i>working within</i> the structure of the contained"
"1.3.1.7.4.3","5","information."
"1.3.1.7.5","1","d. An Experiment Illustrating Usage     and Further System"
"1.3.1.7.5","2","Possibilities"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","1","I once tried to use my cards, with     their separate little"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","2","&quot;concept packets,&quot; in the process of     developing a"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","3","file memo outlining the status and plans of a     research"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","4","project. I first developed a set of cards upon each     of which"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","5","I described a separate consideration, possibility,     or"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","6","specification about the memo--in the disorderly sequence     in"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","7","which they occurred to me as my thoughts about the basic"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","8","features of the memo evolved. Right off the bat I noticed"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","9","that there were two distinct groups--some ideas were about"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","10","what the memo ought to accomplish, what time period it"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","11","should cover, when it should be finished, what level and"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","12","style of presentation should be used, etc., and some ideas"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","13","were about the sub ject of the memo. As more thoughts"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","14","developed, I found that the latter group also divided into"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","15","ideas representing possible content and those representing"
"1.3.1.7.5.1","16","possible organization."
"1.3.1.7.5.2","1","I separated the cards into three     corresponding groups (which"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","2","I shall call Specification,     Organization, and Content), and"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","3","began to organize each of     them. I started with the"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","4","Specification group (it being the     &quot;highest&quot; in"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","5","nature), and immediately found that there were     several types"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","6","of notes within that group Just as there had     been in the"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","7","total group. Becoming immediately suspicious, I     sorted"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","8","through each of the other two main groups and found     similar"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","9","situations in each. In each group there was finally     to"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","10","emerge a definite set of statements (product statements)"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","11","that represented that group's purpose--e.g., the"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","12","specifications currently accepted for the design of the     memo"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","13","--and some of the cards contained candidate material for"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","14","this.  But there were also considerations about what these"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","15","final statements might include or exclude or take into"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","16","account, or conditions under which inclusion or modification"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","17","might be relevant, or statements that were too bulky or"
"1.3.1.7.5.2","18","brief or imprecise to be used as final statements."
"1.3.1.7.5.3","1","It became apparent that the final     issuance from my work, the"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","2","memo itself, would represent but     one facet of a complex"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","3","symbol structure that would grow as     the work progressed--a"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","4","structure comprising three main     substructures, each of which"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","5","had definite substructuring of     its own that was apparent.  I"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","6","realized that I was being     rather philosophi cally"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","7","introspective with all of this     analysis, but I was curious"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","8","as to the potential value of     future augmentation means in"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","9","allowing me to deal explicitly     with these types of"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","10","structuring. So I went ahead, keeping     the groups and sub-"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","11","groups of cards separated, and trying to     organize and"
"1.3.1.7.5.3","12","develop them."
"1.3.1.7.5.4","1","I found rather quickly that the     job of extracting, re"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","2","arranging, editing, and copying new     statements into the"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","3","cards which were to represent the     current set of product"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","4","statements in each grouping was     rather tedious. This brought"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","5","me to appreciate the value of     some sort of copying device"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","6","with which I could transfer     specified strings of words from"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","7","one card to another, thus     composing new statements from"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","8","fragments of existing     ones. This type of device should not"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","9","be too hard to develop     and produce for a price that a"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","10","professional man could     justify paying, and it would"
"1.3.1.7.5.4","11","certainly facilitate some     valuable symbol-structuring pro"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","1","I also found that there would have     been great value in"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","2","having available the associative-trail     marking and following"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","3","processes. Statements very often had     implicit linkages to"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","4","other statements in the same group, and     it would have been"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","5","very useful to keep track of these     associations. For"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","6","instance, when several consideration     statements bore upon a"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","7","given product statement, and when     that product statement"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","8","came to be modified through some     other consideration, it was"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","9","not always easy to remember why     it had been establishe has"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","10","it had. Being able to fish out     the other considerations"
"1.3.1.7.5.5","11","linked to that statement would have     helped considerably."
"1.3.1.7.5.6","1","Also, trial organizations of the     statements in a group could"
"1.3.1.7.5.6","2","be linked into trial associative     trails, so that a number of"
"1.3.1.7.5.6","3","such organizations could be     constructed and considered"
"1.3.1.7.5.6","4","without copying that many sets of     specially ordered"
"1.3.1.7.5.6","5","statements. Any of the previously     considered organizations"
"1.3.1.7.5.6","6","could be reconstructed at will."
"1.3.1.7.5.7","1","In trying to do flexible     structuring and restructuring"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","2","within my experiment, I found     that I just didn't have the"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","3","means to keep track of all of     the kernel statements (cards)"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","4","and the various relation ships     between them that were"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","5","important--at least by means that     were easy enough to leave"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","6","time and thought capacity enough     for me to keep in mind the"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","7","essential nature of the     memo-writing process. But it was a"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","8","very provocative     experience, considering the possibilities"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","9","that I sensed for     the flexible and powerful ways in which I"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","10","could apply myself     to so universal a design task if I but"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","11","had the necessary     means with which to manipulate symbol"
"1.3.1.7.5.7","12","structures."
"1.3.1.7.5.8","1","It would actually seem quite     feasible to develop a unit"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","2","record system around cards and     mechanical sorting, with"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","3","automatic trail establishment and     trail-following facility,"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","4","and with associated means for     selective copying or data"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","5","transfer, that would enable     development of some very"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","6","powerful methodology for everyday     intellectual work. It is"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","7","plain that even if the equipment     (artifacts) appeared on the"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","8","market tomorrow, a good deal of     empirical research would be"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","9","needed to develop a methodology     that would capitalize upon"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","10","the artifact process     capabilities. New concepts need to be"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","11","concelved and tested     relative to the way the &quot;thought"

"1.3.1.7.5.8","13","structures, and relative to the     conceptual presentations"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","14","which become available and the     symbol-manipulation processes"
"1.3.1.7.5.8","15","which provide these     presentations."
"1.3.1.7.5.9","1","Such an approach would present     useful and interesting"
"1.3.1.7.5.9","2","research problems, and could very     likely produce practical"
"1.3.1.7.5.9","3","and significant results (language,     artifacts, methodology)"
"1.3.1.7.5.9","4","for improving the effective ness of     professional problem"

"1.3.1.8.1","1","This section may be of value both to   readers who are already"
"1.3.1.8.1","2","familiar with computers, and to those   who are not. A little"
"1.3.1.8.1","3","familiarity with computer technology,   enough to help"
"1.3.1.8.1","4","considerably in understanding the augmentation   possibilities"
"1.3.1.8.1","5","discussed in thls report, can be gained by the   uninitiated."
"1.3.1.8.1","6","For those already familiar with the technology,   the following"
"1.3.1.8.1","7","discussion can perhaps help them gain more   understanding of"
"1.3.1.8.1","8","our concepts of process and symbol   structuring."
"1.3.1.8.2","1","A computer is directly capable of   performing any of a basic"
"1.3.1.8.2","2","repertoire of very primitive   symbol-manipulation processes"
"1.3.1.8.2","3","(such as &quot;move the symbol in   location A to location"
"1.3.1.8.2","4","12417,&quot; or &quot;compare the symbol in   location A with"
"1.3.1.8.2","5","that in location B, and if they are the same,   set switch S to"
"1.3.1.8.2","6","ON&quot;). There may be from ten to over a hundred   different"
"1.3.1.8.2","7","primitive processes which a particular machine can   execute,"
"1.3.1.8.2","8","and all of the computer's more sophisticated   processes are"
"1.3.1.8.2","9","structured from these primitive processes.  It   takes a"
"1.3.1.8.2","10","repertoire of surprisingly few such primitive   processes to"
"1.3.1.8.2","11","enable the construction of any   symbol-manipulation process"
"1.3.1.8.2","12","that can be explicitly described   in any language."
"1.3.1.8.3","1","Somewhat the same situation exists   relative to symbol"
"1.3.1.8.3","2","structures i.e., there are only a very few   primitive symbols"
"1.3.1.8.3","3","with which the machine can actually work,   and any new and"
"1.3.1.8.3","4","different symbol has to be defined to the   machine as a"

"1.3.1.8.3","6","symbols.  Actually, in every commercial digital   computer,"
"1.3.1.8.3","7","there are only two primitive symbols. Usually these   are dealt"
"1.3.1.8.3","8","with in standard-sized packets (called &quot;words&quot;) of"
"1.3.1.8.3","9","from eighteen to forty-eight primitive symbols, but arbitrary"
"1.3.1.8.3","10","use can be made of individual primitives or of subgroups of"
"1.3.1.8.3","11","the word."
"1.3.1.8.4","1","To have the computer perform a   non-trivial task or process, a"
"1.3.1.8.4","2","structure of the primitive   processes is organized (a computer"
"1.3.1.8.4","3","program) and stored within   the computer as a corresponding"
"1.3.1.8.4","4","symbol structure. The computer   successively examines the"
"1.3.1.8.4","5","symbol substructure representing   each primitive process in the"
"1.3.1.8.4","6","program and executes that   process--which usually alters the"
"1.3.1.8.4","7","total internal symbol   structure of the machine in some way. Lt"
"1.3.1.8.4","8","makes no difference   to the computer whether the symbols"
"1.3.1.8.4","9","involved in the   re-structuring represent part of the computer"
"1.3.1.8.4","10","program or part   of the lnformation upon which the program is"
"1.3.1.8.4","11","operating. The   ability to have the computer modify its own"
"1.3.1.8.4","12","process structure   (program) hss been a very im portant factor"
"1.3.1.8.4","13","in the development   of its power."
"1.3.1.8.5","1","Thus, some very sophisticated   techniques for process and"
"1.3.1.8.5","2","symbol structuring have evolved in   the computer field, as"
"1.3.1.8.5","3","evidenced by the very sophisticated   processes (e.g.,"
"1.3.1.8.5","4","predicting election returns, calculating   orbits, translating"
"1.3.1.8.5","5","natural languages) that can be structured   to manipulate very"
"1.3.1.8.5","6","complex structures of symbols. Among the   more interesting"
"1.3.1.8.5","7","computer-process structures that have evolved   are those that"
"1.3.1.8.5","8","can automatically develop a structure of   primitive computer"
"1.3.1.8.5","9","processes to accomplish symbol manipulation   tasks that are"
"1.3.1.8.5","10","specified on a relatively high level of   abstraction. Special"
"1.3.1.8.5","11","languages have been evolved in several   fields (e.g., ALGOL and"
"1.3.1.8.5","12","FORTRAN for scientific calculations,   COBOL for business"
"1.3.1.8.5","13","processing) that enable explicit   prescription of complex"
"1.3.1.8.5","14","manipulation processes in a rapid and   concise manner by a"
"1.3.1.8.5","15","human, thinking about the processes in a   rather natural"
"1.3.1.8.5","16","manner, so that special computer programs or   process"
"1.3.1.8.5","17","structures (called Translators, Compilers, or   sometimes in a"
"1.3.1.8.5","18","slightly different sense, Interpreters) can   construct the"
"1.3.1.8.5","19","necessary structures of primitive processes and   symbols that"
"1.3.1.8.5","20","would enable the computer to execute the   prescribed processes."
"1.3.1.8.5","21","This development has extended immensely   our capability for"
"1.3.1.8.5","22","making use of computers--otherwise the   specification of a"
"1.3.1.8.5","23","complex process would often occupy a   formidable number of man"
"1.3.1.8.5","24","hours, and be subject to a great many   errors which would be"
"1.3.1.8.5","25","very costly to find and correct."
"1.3.1.8.6","1","Computers have been used to simulate   dynamic systems for which"
"1.3.1.8.6","2","we humans had none but descriptive   models, from which we"
"1.3.1.8.6","3","otherwise could gain little feel for the   way the system"
"1.3.1.8.6","4","behaves. A very notable instance of this, for   our"
"1.3.1.8.6","5","consideration, has been in the area of the human thought"
"1.3.1.8.6","6","processes.  Newell, Shaw, and Simon initiated this approach)"
"1.3.1.8.6","7","from which there has derived a number of features of interest"
"1.3.1.8.6","8","to us. For one, they discovered that the symbol structures and"
"1.3.1.8.6","9","the process structures required for such simulation became"
"1.3.1.8.6","10","exceedingly complex, and the burden of organizing these was a"
"1.3.1.8.6","11","terrific impediment to their simulation research. They devised"
"1.3.1.8.6","12","a structurlng technique for their symbols that is basically"
"1.3.1.8.6","13","simple but from which stem results that are very   elegant."
"1.3.1.8.6","14","Their baslc symbol structure is what they call a   'list,&quot;"
"1.3.1.8.6","15","a string of substructures that are linked serially in   exactly"
"1.3.1.8.6","16","the manner proposed by Bush for the associative trails   in his"
"1.3.1.8.6","17","Memex--i.e., each substructure contains the necessary"
"1.3.1.8.6","18","information for locating the next substructure on the   list."
"1.3.1.8.6","19","Here, though, each substructure could also be a list of"
"1.3.1.8.6","20","substructures, and each of these could also, etc. Their"
"1.3.1.8.6","21","standard manner for organizing the data which the computer was"
"1.3.1.8.6","22","to operate upon is thus what they term &quot;list"
"1.3.1.8.6","23","structuring.&quot;"
"1.3.1.8.7","1","They also developed special languages   to descrlbe different"
"1.3.1.8.7","2","basic processes involved in   list-structure manipulation. The"
"1.3.1.8.7","3","most widely used of their   languages, IPL-V (the fifth version"
"1.3.1.8.7","4","of their Information   Processing Languages), is described in a"
"1.3.1.8.7","5","recent book edited by   Newell.(<a"
"1.3.1.8.7","6","href=&quot;#Ref-7&quot;>7</a>) In these languages, both   the"
"1.3.1.8.7","7","data to be worked upon and the symbols which designate the"
"1.3.1.8.7","8","processes to be executed upon that data are developed in   list-"
"1.3.1.8.7","9","structure form."
"1.3.1.8.8","1","Other languages and techniques for   the manipulation of list"
"1.3.1.8.8","2","structures have been described by McCarthy,(<a"
"1.3.1.8.8","3","href=&quot;#Ref-8&quot;>8</a>) by Gelernter, Hansen, and"

"1.3.1.8.8","9","href=&quot;#Ref-14&quot;>14</a>) The application of these"
"1.3.1.8.8","10","techniques   has been mainly of two types--one of modelling"
"1.3.1.8.8","11","complex   processes and systems (e.g., the human thought"
"1.3.1.8.8","12","processes),   where the emphasis is upon the model and its"
"1.3.1.8.8","13","behavior, and the   other of trying to get computer behavior"
"1.3.1.8.8","14","that is intelligent   whether or not the processes and behavior"
"1.3.1.8.8","15","resemble those of a   human. The languages and techniques used"
"1.3.1.8.8","16","in both types of   application promise to be of considerable"
"1.3.1.8.8","17","value to the   development of radical new augmentation systems"
"1.3.1.8.8","18","for human   problem solvers, and we shall deal later with them"
"1.3.1.8.8","19","in more   detail."
"1.3.1.8.9","1","Computers have various means for   storing symbols so that they"
"1.3.1.8.9","2","are accessible to it for   manipulation. Assuming that the human"
"1.3.1.8.9","3","might want to have a   repertoire of sixty-four basic symbols"
"1.3.1.8.9","4","(letters, numbers,   special symbols), we can discuss various"
"1.3.1.8.9","5","forms of storage in   terms of their capacity for storing these"
"1.3.1.8.9","6","kinds of symbols   (each oi which would be structured, in the"
"1.3.1.8.9","7","computer and   storage devices, as a group of six primitive"
"1.3.1.8.9","8","computer   symbols). Fast access to an arbitrary choice of a few"
"1.3.1.8.9","9","neighboring symbols (of the human's repertoire) can be had to"
"1.3.1.8.9","10","perhaps 100,000 such symbols within the period in which the"
"1.3.1.8.9","11","computer can execute one of its primitive processes (from two"
"1.3.1.8.9","12","to ten millionths of a second, depending upon the computer"
"1.3.1.8.9","13","involved).  This is the so-called high-speed, random-access"
"1.3.1.8.9","14","working store, where space for the human's symbols might cost"
"1.3.1.8.9","15","between sixty cents and $1.50 per symbol."
"1.3.1.8.10","1","Cheaper, larger-capacity backup   storage is usually provided by"
"1.3.1.8.10","2","devices to which access takes   considerably longer (in the"
"1.3.1.8.10","3","computer's time reference).  A   continuously rotating magnetic"
"1.3.1.8.10","4","drum can hold perhaps a million   of these symbols, for which"
"1.3.1.8.10","5","access to a random storage   position may average a thirtieth of"
"1.3.1.8.10","6","a second (waiting for the   drum to come around to bring that"
"1.3.1.8.10","7","storage position under the   magnetic reading head). This is"
"1.3.1.8.10","8","short in the human's time   scale, but a reasonably fast"
"1.3.1.8.10","9","computer could execute about   3,000 of its primitive processes"
"1.3.1.8.10","10","during that time. Generally,   information transfer between a"
"1.3.1.8.10","11","drum and fast-access working   storage takes place in blocks of"
"1.3.1.8.10","12","data which are stored in   successive positions around the drum."
"1.3.1.8.10","13","Such block-transfer is   accomplished by a relatively small"
"1.3.1.8.10","14","structure of primitive   computer processes that cyclically"
"1.3.1.8.10","15","executes the transfer of   one word at a time until the"
"1.3.1.8.10","16","designated block has been trans   ferred. Drum storage costs"
"1.3.1.8.10","17","about 5 cents per each of the basic   symbols used by the human"
"1.3.1.8.10","18","in our example."
"1.3.1.8.11","1","Another type of backup storage uses a   number of large, thin"
"1.3.1.8.11","2","discs (about three feet in diameter),   with magnetic coating on"
"1.3.1.8.11","3","the sur faces. The discs are stacked   with enough space between"
"1.3.1.8.11","4","each so that a moveable read-record   head can be positioned"
"1.3.1.8.11","5","radially to line up over a specific   circular track of symbol"
"1.3.1.8.11","6","storage space. A commercially   available disc storage system"
"1.3.1.8.11","7","could hold over a hundred   million of the human's basic"
"1.3.1.8.11","8","symbols, to which random access   would average about a tenth of"
"1.3.1.8.11","9","a second, and where the cost   per symbol-space would be about"
"1.3.1.8.11","10","one seventh of a cent."
"1.3.1.8.12","1","Magnetic tapes are commonly used for   backup storage, too. For"
"1.3.1.8.12","2","these, the random access time for   storage blocks are of the"
"1.3.1.8.12","3","order of a minute or two. Here,   however, the actual storage"
"1.3.1.8.12","4","units (the tape reels) can be   taken off and shelf stored, so"
"1.3.1.8.12","5","the total storage capacity may   be very large--however, the"
"1.3.1.8.12","6","time to locate a reel and exchange   reels on the tape transport"
"1.3.1.8.12","7","adds to the above-quoted access   time--and this locating and"
"1.3.1.8.12","8","reel changing are not generally   automatic processes (i.e., a"
"1.3.1.8.12","9","human has to do them). A   transport unit, connected to the"
"1.3.1.8.12","10","computer, might cost $30,000,   with tape reels at $50 each"
"1.3.1.8.12","11","holding about five million of the   human's basic symbols. For"
"1.3.1.8.12","12","one reel, storage space for each   such symbol cost about two-"
"1.3.1.8.12","13","thirds of a cent, but for twenty   full reels in a"
"1.3.1.8.12","14","&quot;library&quot; the cost comes down to about   one-thirtieth"
"1.3.1.8.12","15","of a cent per symbol space."
"1.3.1.8.13","1","Other types of buffer storage for   computer symbol structures"
"1.3.1.8.13","2","are becoming available, and there   is considerable economic"
"1.3.1.8.13","3","demand spurring continuing research   toward storage means that"
"1.3.1.8.13","4","give high capacity at low cost, and   with as short an access"
"1.3.1.8.13","5","time as possible. Within the next ten   years there would seem"
"1.3.1.8.13","6","to be a very high probability of   significant ad vances to this"
"1.3.1.8.13","7","end."
"1.3.1.8.14","1","For presenting computer-stored   information to the human,"
"1.3.1.8.14","2","techniques have been developed by   which a cathode-ray-tube (of"
"1.3.1.8.14","3","which the television picture tube   is a familiar example) can"
"1.3.1.8.14","4","be made to present symbols on their   screens of quite good"
"1.3.1.8.14","5","brightness, clarity, and with   considerable freedom as to the"
"1.3.1.8.14","6","form of the symbol. Under   computer control an arbitrary"
"1.3.1.8.14","7","collection of symbols may be   arranged on the screen, with"
"1.3.1.8.14","8","considerable freedom as to   relative location, size, and"
"1.3.1.8.14","9","brightness. Similarly, line   drawings, curves, and graphs may"
"1.3.1.8.14","10","be presented, with any of the   other symbols intermixed.  It is"
"1.3.1.8.14","11","possible to describe to the   computer, and thereafter use, new"
"1.3.1.8.14","12","symbols of arbitrary shape   and size. On displays of this sort,"
"1.3.1.8.14","13","a light pen (a pen-shaped   tool with a flexible wire to the"
"1.3.1.8.14","14","electronic console) can be   pointed by the human at any symbol"
"1.3.1.8.14","15","or line on the display, and   the computer can automatically"
"1.3.1.8.14","16","determine what the pen is   pointing at."
"1.3.1.8.15","1","A cathode-ray-tube display of this   sort is currently limited"
"1.3.1.8.15","2","in resolution to about 800 lines   across the face of the tube"
"1.3.1.8.15","3","(in either direction). The detail   with which a symbol may be"
"1.3.1.8.15","4","formed, and the preciseness with   which the recurrent images of"
"1.3.1.8.15","5","it may be located, are both   affected by this figure so that no"
"1.3.1.8.15","6","matter how large the screen   of such a tube, the maximum number"
"1.3.1.8.15","7","of symbols that can be put   on with usable clearness remains"
"1.3.1.8.15","8","the same."
"1.3.1.8.16","1","The amount of usable information on   such a screen, in the form"
"1.3.1.8.16","2","of letters, numbers, and diagrams,   would be limited to about"
"1.3.1.8.16","3","what a normal human eye could make   out at the normal reading"
"1.3.1.8.16","4","distance of fourteen inches on a   surface 3-1/2 inches square,"

"1.3.1.8.16","9","as he might be used to seeing, say on the page   of a journal"
"1.3.1.8.16","10","article."
"1.3.1.8.17","1","The costs of such displays are now   quite high--ranging from"
"1.3.1.8.17","2","$20,000 to $60,000, depending upon   the symbol repertoire,"
"1.3.1.8.17","3","symbol-structure display capacity, and   the quality of the"
"1.3.1.8.17","4","symbol forms. One sbould expect these   prices to be lowered"
"1.3.1.8.17","5","quite drastically as our technology   improves and the market"
"1.3.1.8.17","6","for these displays increases."
"1.3.1.8.18","1","Much cheaper devices can &quot;draw&quot;   arbitrary symbol"
"1.3.1.8.18","2","shapes and diagrams on paper, at a speed for   symbols that is"
"1.3.1.8.18","3","perhaps a quarter of the rate that a   typewriter can produce"
"1.3.1.8.18","4","them. Also, special typewriters (at   $3,000 to $4,000 apiece)"

"1.3.1.9.1","15","the   implications we derived from his work. We look forward to"

"1.3.1.9.2","1","However, we do want to acknowledge thoughts and work we have"

"1.3.1.9.2","3","using a computer in real-time   working association with a human"
"1.3.1.9.2","4","to improve his working   effectiveness.  These fall into two"

"1.3.1.9.2","8","(<a href=&quot;#Ref-6&quot;>6</a>) is the earliest and one of"
"1.3.1.9.2","9","the most   directly stimulating. Licklider (<a"

"1.3.1.9.4","12","facility on the TX-2 computer at Lincoln   Lab to develop"
"1.3.1.9.4","13","cooperative techniques for engineering-design   problems. And at"
"1.3.1.9.4","14","RAND, we have learned by personal discussion   that Cliff Shaw,"
"1.3.1.9.4","15","Tom Ellis, and Keith Uncapher have been   involved in"
"1.3.1.9.4","16","implementing a multi-station time-sharing system   built around"

"1.3.1.9.5","1","Undoubtedly, there are efforts of   others falling into either"
"1.3.1.9.5","2","or both categories that have been   overlooked. Such oversight"

"1.3.2","1","B. HYPOTHETICAL DESCRIPTION OF COMPUTER-BASED AUGMENTATION"
"1.3.2","2","SYSTEM"
"1.3.2.1","1","Let us consider some specific possibilities for redesigning the"
"1.3.2.1","2","augmentation means for an intellectually oriented, problem-"
"1.3.2.1","3","solving human. We choose to present those developments of"
"1.3.2.1","4","language and methodology that can capitalize upon the symbol-"
"1.3.2.1","5","manipulating and portraying capabilities of computer-based"
"1.3.2.1","6","equipment. The picture of the possibilities to pursue will"
"1.3.2.1","7","change and grow rapidly as research gets under way, but we need"
"1.3.2.1","8","to provide what pictures we can--to give substance to the"
"1.3.2.1","9","generalities developed in Section II, to try to impart our"
"1.3.2.1","10","feeling of rich promise, and to introduce a possible research"
"1.3.2.1","11","program (Section IV)."
"1.3.2.2","1","Although our generalizations (about augmentation means,"
"1.3.2.2","2","capability hierarchies, and mental-, concept-, symbol-,"
"1.3.2.2","3","process-, and physical structuring) might retain their validity"
"1.3.2.2","4","in the future--for instance, our generalized prediction that new"
"1.3.2.2","5","developments in concept, symbol, and process structuring will"
"1.3.2.2","6","prove to be tremendously important--the specific concepts,"
"1.3.2.2","7","symbol structures, and processes that evolve will most likely"
"1.3.2.2","8","differ from what we know and use now. In fact, even if we in"
"1.3.2.2","9","some way could know now what would emerge after say, ten years"
"1.3.2.2","10","of research, it is likely that any but a general description"
"1.3.2.2","11","would be difficult to express in today's terminology."
"1.3.2.3","1","1. Background"
"1.3.2.3.1","1","To try to give you (the reader) a   specific sort of feel for"
"1.3.2.3.1","2","our thesis in spite of this   situation, we shall present the"
"1.3.2.3.1","3","following picture of   computer-based augmentation possibilities"
"1.3.2.3.1","4","by describing what   might happen if you were being given a"
"1.3.2.3.1","5","personal   discussion-demonstration by a friendly fellow (named"
"1.3.2.3.1","6","Joe) who   is a trained and experienced user of such an"
"1.3.2.3.1","7","augmentation   system within an experimental research program"
"1.3.2.3.1","8","which is   several years beyond our present stage. We assume"
"1.3.2.3.1","9","that you   approach this demonstration-interview with a"
"1.3.2.3.1","10","background   similar to what the previous portion of this report"
"1.3.2.3.1","11","provides--that is, you will have heard or read a set of"
"1.3.2.3.1","12","generalizations and a few rather primitive examples, but you"
"1.3.2.3.1","13","will not yet have been given much of a feel for how a"
"1.3.2.3.1","14","computer-based augmentation system can really help a   person."
"1.3.2.3.2","1","Joe understands this and explains   that he will do his best to"
"1.3.2.3.2","2","give you the valid conceptual feel   that you want--trying to"
"1.3.2.3.2","3","tread the narrow line between being   too detailed and losing"
"1.3.2.3.2","4","your over-all view anc being too   general and not providing you"
"1.3.2.3.2","5","with a solid feel for what goes   on. He suggests that you sit"
"1.3.2.3.2","6","and watch him for a while as he   pursues some typical work,"
"1.3.2.3.2","7","after which he will do some   explaining. You are not"
"1.3.2.3.2","8","particularly flattered by this, since   you know that he is just"
"1.3.2.3.2","9","going to be exercising new language   and methodology"
"1.3.2.3.2","10","developments on his new artifacts--and after   all, the"
"1.3.2.3.2","11","artifacts don't look a bit different from what you   expected--"
"1.3.2.3.2","12","so why should he keep you sitting there as if you   were a"
"1.3.2.3.2","13","complete stranger to this stuff? It will just be a   matter of"
"1.3.2.3.2","14","&quot;having the computer do some of his   symbol-manipulating"
"1.3.2.3.2","15","processes for him so that he can use more   powerful concepts"
"1.3.2.3.2","16","and concept-manipulation techniques,&quot; as you   have so"
"1.3.2.3.2","17","often been told."
"1.3.2.3.3","1","Joe has two display screens side by   side, but one of them he"
"1.3.2.3.3","2","doesn't seem to use as much as the   other. And the screens are"
"1.3.2.3.3","3","almost horizontal, more like the   surface of a drafting table"
"1.3.2.3.3","4","than the near-vertical picture   displays you had somehow"
"1.3.2.3.3","5","imagined. But you see the reason   easily, for he is working on"
"1.3.2.3.3","6","the display surface as intently   as a draftsman works on his"
"1.3.2.3.3","7","drawings, and it would be awkward   to reach out to a vertical"
"1.3.2.3.3","8","surface for this kind of work. Some   of the time Joe is using"
"1.3.2.3.3","9","both hands on the keys, obviously   feeding information into the"
"1.3.2.3.3","10","computer at a great rate."
"1.3.2.3.4","1","Another slight surprise, though--you   see that each hand"
"1.3.2.3.4","2","operates on a set of keys on its own side   of the display"
"1.3.2.3.4","3","frames, so that the hands are almost two feet   apart. But it is"
"1.3.2.3.4","4","plain that this arrangement allows him to   remain positioned"
"1.3.2.3.4","5","over the frames in a rather natural   position, so that when he"
"1.3.2.3.4","6","picks the light pen out of the air   (which is its rest"
"1.3.2.3.4","7","position, thanks to a system of jointed   supporting arms and a"
"1.3.2.3.4","8","controlled tension and rewind system for   the attached cord)"
"1.3.2.3.4","9","his hand is still on the way from the   keyset to the display"
"1.3.2.3.4","10","frame. When he is through with the pen   at the display frame,"
"1.3.2.3.4","11","he lets go of it, the cord rewinds, and   the pen is again in"
"1.3.2.3.4","12","position. There is thus a minimum of   effort, movement, and"
"1.3.2.3.4","13","time involved in turning to work on the   frame. That is, he"
"1.3.2.3.4","14","could easily shift back and forth from   using keyset to using"
"1.3.2.3.4","15","light pen, with either hand (one pen is   positioned for each"
"1.3.2.3.4","16","hand), without moving his head, turning,   or leaning."
"1.3.2.3.5","1","A good deal of Joe's time, though,   seems to be spent with one"
"1.3.2.3.5","2","hand on a keyset and the other   using a light pen on the"
"1.3.2.3.5","3","display surface. It is in this type   of working mode that the"
"1.3.2.3.5","4","images on the display frames changed   most dynamically. You"
"1.3.2.3.5","5","receive another real surprise as you   realize how much activity"
"1.3.2.3.5","6","there is on the face of these   display tubes. You ask yourself"
"1.3.2.3.5","7","why you weren't prepared for   this, and you are forced to admit"
"1.3.2.3.5","8","that the generalizations you   had heard hadn't really sunk"
"1.3.2.3.5","9","in--&quot;new methods for manipulating   symbols&quot; had been"
"1.3.2.3.5","10","an oft-repeated term, but it just hadn't   included for you the"
"1.3.2.3.5","11","images of the free and rapid way in which   Joe could make"
"1.3.2.3.5","12","changes in the display, and of meaningful and   flexible"
"1.3.2.3.5","13","&quot;shaping&quot; of ideas and work status which could take"
"1.3.2.3.5","14","place so rapidly."
"1.3.2.3.6","1","Then you realized that you couldn't   make any sense at all out"
"1.3.2.3.6","2","of the specific things he was doing,   nor of the major part of"
"1.3.2.3.6","3","what you saw on the displays. You   could recognize many words,"
"1.3.2.3.6","4","but there were a good number that   were obviously special"
"1.3.2.3.6","5","abbreviations of some sort. During the   times when a given"
"1.3.2.3.6","6","image or portion of an image remained un   changed long enough"
"1.3.2.3.6","7","for you to study it a bit, you rarely saw   anything that looked"
"1.3.2.3.6","8","llke a sentence as you were used to   seeing one. You were"
"1.3.2.3.6","9","beginning to gather that there were other   symbols mixed with"
"1.3.2.3.6","10","the words that might be part of a sentence,   and that the"
"1.3.2.3.6","11","different parts of what made a full-thought   statement (your"
"1.3.2.3.6","12","feeling about what a sentence is) were not   just laid out end"
"1.3.2.3.6","13","to end as you expected. But Joe suddenly   cleared the displays"
"1.3.2.3.6","14","and turned to you with a grin that   signalled the end of the"
"1.3.2.3.6","15","passive observation period, and also   that somehow told you"
"1.3.2.3.6","16","that he knew very well that you now knew   that you had needed"
"1.3.2.3.6","17","such a period to shake out some of your   limited images and to"
"1.3.2.3.6","18","really realize that a &quot;capability   hierarchy&quot; was a"
"1.3.2.3.6","19","rich and vital thing."
"1.3.2.3.7","1","&quot;I guess you noticed that I was using   unfamiliar notions,"
"1.3.2.3.7","2","symbols, and processes to go about doing   things that were even"
"1.3.2.3.7","3","more unfamiliar to you?&quot; You made a   non-committal nod--"
"1.3.2.3.7","4","you saw no reason to admit to him that you   hadn't even been"
"1.3.2.3.7","5","able to tell which of the things he had been   doing were to"
"1.3.2.3.7","6","cooperate with which other things--and he   continued. &quot;To"
"1.3.2.3.7","7","give you a feel for what goes on, I'm going to   start"
"1.3.2.3.7","8","discussing and demonstrating some of the very basic   operations"
"1.3.2.3.7","9","and notions I've been using. You've read the stuff   about"
"1.3.2.3.7","10","process and process-capability hierarchies, I'm sure. I   know"
"1.3.2.3.7","11","from past experience in explaining radical augmentation"
"1.3.2.3.7","12","systems to people that the new and powerful higher-level"
"1.3.2.3.7","13","capabilities that they are interested in--because basically"
"1.3.2.3.7","14","those are what we are all anxious to improve--can't really be"
"1.3.2.3.7","15","explained to them without first giving them some understanding"
"1.3.2.3.7","16","of the new and powerful capabilities upon which they are"
"1.3.2.3.7","17","built. This holds true right on down the line to the type of"
"1.3.2.3.7","18","low-level capability that is new and different to them all"
"1.3.2.3.7","19","right, but that they just wouldn't ordinarily see as being"
"1.3.2.3.7","20","'powerful.' And yet our systems wouldn't be anywhere near as"
"1.3.2.3.7","21","powerful without them, and a person's comprehension of the"
"1.3.2.3.7","22","system would be rather shallow if he didn't have some"
"1.3.2.3.7","23","understanding of these basic capabilities and of the"
"1.3.2.3.7","24","hierarchical structure built up from them to provide the"
"1.3.2.3.7","25","highest-level capabilities.&quot;"
"1.3.2.4","1","2. Single-Frame Composition"
"1.3.2.4.1","1","&quot;For explanation purposes here, let's   say that the lowest"
"1.3.2.4.1","2","level at which the computer system comes   into direct play in"
"1.3.2.4.1","3","my capability hierarchy is in the task of   what I'll call"
"1.3.2.4.1","4","'single-frame composition.' We'll stick to   working with prose"
"1.3.2.4.1","5","text in our examples--most people can grasp   easily enough what"
"1.3.2.4.1","6","we are doing there without having to have   special backgrounds"
"1.3.2.4.1","7","in mathematics or science as they would to   gain equal"
"1.3.2.4.1","8","comprehension for some of the similar sorts of   things we do"
"1.3.2.4.1","9","with diagrams and mathematical equations. This   low-level"
"1.3.2.4.1","10","composition task is just what you normally do with a   pen or"
"1.3.2.4.1","11","pencil or typewriter on a piece of paper-- that is,   assemble a"
"1.3.2.4.1","12","bunch of symbols before your eyes in order to   portray"
"1.3.2.4.1","13","something which you have in mind.&quot;"
"1.3.2.4.2","1","You listened and watched as Joe   showed you some of the"
"1.3.2.4.2","2","different ways in which the composition   of straightforward"
"1.3.2.4.2","3","text was made easier for him in this   system. With either hand,"
"1.3.2.4.2","4","Joe could &quot;type&quot; (the keysets didn't   look at all"
"1.3.2.4.2","5","like typewriter keyboards) individual letters and   numbers, and"
"1.3.2.4.2","6","if he had directed it to do so, the computer   would put each"
"1.3.2.4.2","7","successive symbol next to its predecessor just   as a typewriter"
"1.3.2.4.2","8","does--only here there was completely automatic   &quot;carriage"
"1.3.2.4.2","9","return&quot; service. This didn't impress you very much,   since"
"1.3.2.4.2","10","an automatic carriage-return feature was sort of a   trivial"
"1.3.2.4.2","11","return on the investment behind all of this   equipment--but"
"1.3.2.4.2","12","then you reflected that, as long as the   computer was there"
"1.3.2.4.2","13","anyway, to help do all the flashy things   you had witnessed"
"1.3.2.4.2","14","earlier, one might as well use it in all of   the little helpful"
"1.3.2.4.2","15","ways he could."
"1.3.2.4.3","1","But there were other ways in which   help was derived for this"
"1.3.2.4.3","2","composition task. He showed you how   he could call up the"
"1.3.2.4.3","3","dictionary definition to any word he had   typed in, with but a"
"1.3.2.4.3","4","few quick flicks on the keyset. Synonyms   or antonyms could"
"1.3.2.4.3","5","just as easily be brought forth. This also   seemed sort of"
"1.3.2.4.3","6","trivially obvious, and Joe seemed to know that   you would feel"
"1.3.2.4.3","7","so. &quot;It turns out that this simple capability   makes it"
"1.3.2.4.3","8","feasible to do some pretty rough tasks in the upper   levels of"
"1.3.2.4.3","9","the capability hierarchy--where precise use of   special terms"
"1.3.2.4.3","10","really pays off, where the human just couldn't   be that precise"
"1.3.2.4.3","11","by depending upon his unaided memory for   definitions and"
"1.3.2.4.3","12","'standards,' and where using dictionary and   reference-book"
"1.3.2.4.3","13","lookup in the normal fashion would be so   distracting and time-"
"1.3.2.4.3","14","consuming that the task execution would   break down. We've"
"1.3.2.4.3","15","tried taking this feature away in some of   these processes up"
"1.3.2.4.3","16","there, and believe me, the result was a   mess."
"1.3.2.4.4","1","You could get some dim feeling for   what he meant, having"
"1.3.2.4.4","2","watched him working for a while, but you   were nevertheless"
"1.3.2.4.4","3","much relieved to find the next thing he   showed you to be more"
"1.3.2.4.4","4","directly impressive. He showed you how   he could single out a"
"1.3.2.4.4","5","group of words (called the &quot;object   symbol string,&quot;"
"1.3.2.4.4","6","or simply &quot;object string&quot;) and define an"
"1.3.2.4.4","7","abbreviation term, composed of any string of symbols he might"
"1.3.2.4.4","8","choose, that became associated with the object string in"
"1.3.2.4.4","9","computer storage. At any later time (until he chose to discard"
"1.3.2.4.4","10","that particular abbreviation from his working voca bulary) the"
"1.3.2.4.4","11","typing of the abbreviation term would call forth automatically"
"1.3.2.4.4","12","the &quot;printing&quot; on the display of the entire object"
"1.3.2.4.4","13","string. Joe   showed you another way in which this abbreviation"
"1.3.2.4.4","14","feature   might work. He &quot;arranged&quot; for the computer"
"1.3.2.4.4","15","to print the   abbreviation on the display, just the way he"
"1.3.2.4.4","16","typed it in. At a   subsequent reading, if he had for gotten"
"1.3.2.4.4","17","what the abbreviation   stood for, he could call for"
"1.3.2.4.4","18","substitution of the full object   string to refresh his memory."
"1.3.2.4.5","1","Then he showed you how this sort of   facility had been"
"1.3.2.4.5","2","extended, in a refined way, to provide a   rather powerful sort"
"1.3.2.4.5","3","of shorthand. He could hit a great many   combinations of keys"
"1.3.2.4.5","4","on his keyset--i.e., any one stroke of   his hand could depress"
"1.3.2.4.5","5","a number of keys, which gave him over a   thousand unique"
"1.3.2.4.5","6","single-stroke signals to the computer with   either hand. Some"
"1.3.2.4.5","7","of these signals were used as abbreviations   for entire words."
"1.3.2.4.5","8","It seems that, for instance, the 150 most   commonly used words"
"1.3.2.4.5","9","in a natural language made up about half   of any normal text in"
"1.3.2.4.5","10","that language. Joe said that it was thus   quite feasible to"
"1.3.2.4.5","11","learn and use the single-stroke   abbreviations for about half"
"1.3.2.4.5","12","of the words he used, but beyond   that each added percent began"
"1.3.2.4.5","13","to require him to have too many   abbreviations under his"
"1.3.2.4.5","14","command. But he said that there were a   lot of word endings,"
"1.3.2.4.5","15","letter pairs (diagrams), and letter   triplets (trigrams) that"
"1.3.2.4.5","16","were so common as to make it pay to   abbreviate them to a"
"1.3.2.4.5","17","single stroke. A whole word so   abbreviated saved typing all"
"1.3.2.4.5","18","the letters as well as the spaces   at either side of the word,"
"1.3.2.4.5","19","and a word-ending abbreviated by a   single stroke saved typing"
"1.3.2.4.5","20","the letters and the end-of-word   space. He claimed that he"
"1.3.2.4.5","21","could comfortably rattle off about   180 words a minute--faster"
"1.3.2.4.5","22","than he could comfortably talk. You   believed him after he"
"1.3.2.4.5","23","transcribed your talking for a minute or   so, and it gave you"
"1.3.2.4.5","24","an eerie feeling to see the near   instantaneous appearance of"
"1.3.2.4.5","25","your words and sentences in neat   printed form."
"1.3.2.4.6","1","Joe said that there were other   miscellaneous simple features,"
"1.3.2.4.6","2","and some quite sophisticated   features to help the composition"
"1.3.2.4.6","3","process. He made some brief   references to statistical"
"1.3.2.4.6","4","predictions that the com puter could   make regarding what you"
"1.3.2.4.6","5","were golng to type next, and that if   you got reasonably"
"1.3.2.4.6","6","skillful you could &quot;steer through the   extrapolated"
"1.3.2.4.6","7","prediction field&quot; as you entered your information   and"
"1.3.2.4.6","8","often save energy and time. You gathered that he thought   you"
"1.3.2.4.6","9","would saturate about there on this particular subject,   because"
"1.3.2.4.6","10","he went on to the next."
"1.3.2.5","1","3. Single-Frame Manipulation"
"1.3.2.5.1","1","&quot;Even if I couldn't actually specify   new symbols here any"
"1.3.2.5.1","2","faster than with a typewriter, the   extreme flexibility that"
"1.3.2.5.1","3","this computer system provides for   making changes in what is"
"1.3.2.5.1","4","presented on the display screen   would make me very much more"
"1.3.2.5.1","5","effective in creating finished   text than I could ever be on a"
"1.3.2.5.1","6","typewriter.&quot; With this   statement, Joe proceeded to show"
"1.3.2.5.1","7","you what he meant. The frame   full of your transcribed speech"
"1.3.2.5.1","8","was still showing, and it   represented the clumsy phrasing and"
"1.3.2.5.1","9","illogical progression of   thought so typical of extemporaneous"
"1.3.2.5.1","10","speech. Joe took the   light gun in his right hand, and with a"
"1.3.2.5.1","11","deft flick of it,   coordinated with a stroke of his left hand"
"1.3.2.5.1","12","on its keyset,   caused the silent and instantaneous deletion of"
"1.3.2.5.1","13","a superfluous   word. The word disappeared from the frame, and"
"1.3.2.5.1","14","the rest of the   text simultaneously readjusted to present the"
"1.3.2.5.1","15","neat, no-gap,   full-line appearance it had had."
"1.3.2.5.2","1","With but slightly more motion of his   light pen, he could"
"1.3.2.5.2","2","similarly delete any string of words or   letters. He"
"1.3.2.5.2","3","demonstrated this by cutting out what I thought to   be some"
"1.3.2.5.2","4","relevant prose, and then he showed how the system   allowed for"
"1.3.2.5.2","5","second thoughts about such human-directed   processes--those"
"1.3.2.5.2","6","words were automatically saved for a brief   period in case he"
"1.3.2.5.2","7","wanted to call them back. Leaving his light   pen pointed at the"
"1.3.2.5.2","8","space where a deleted symbol string used to   be, Joe could"
"1.3.2.5.2","9","reinstate it instantaneously with one stroke of   his left hand."
"1.3.2.5.3","1","Adding one more light-pen pointing to   what it took to delete"
"1.3.2.5.3","2","an arbitrary string of symbols, Joe   could direct the computer"
"1.3.2.5.3","3","to move that string from where it   was to insert it at a new"
"1.3.2.5.3","4","point which his light pen   designated.  Again it would"
"1.3.2.5.3","5","disappear instantaneously from   where it had been, but now the"
"1.3.2.5.3","6","modified display would show the   old text to have been spread"
"1.3.2.5.3","7","apart just enough at the   indicated point to hold this string."
"1.3.2.5.3","8","The text would all still   look as neat as if freshly retyped."
"1.3.2.5.3","9","With similar types of   keyset and light-pen operations, Joe"
"1.3.2.5.3","10","could change paragraph   break points, transpose two arbitrary"
"1.3.2.5.3","11","symbol strings (words,   sentences, paragraphs, etc., or"
"1.3.2.5.3","12","fragments thereof), readjust   margins of arbitrary sections of"
"1.3.2.5.3","13","text--essentially being able   to affect immediately any of the"
"1.3.2.5.3","14","changes that a proofreader   might want to designate with his"
"1.3.2.5.3","15","special marks, only here the   proofreader is always looking at"
"1.3.2.5.3","16","clean text as if it had been   instantaneously retyped after"
"1.3.2.5.3","17","each designation had been   made."
"1.3.2.5.4","1","Joe also demonstrated how he could   request that each instance"
"1.3.2.5.4","2","of the use of a given term be   changed to a newly designated"
"1.3.2.5.4","3","term, and this would again be   instantaneously accomplished."
"1.3.2.5.4","4","Also, he could arbitrarily set   the margins between which any"
"1.3.2.5.4","5","section of text must appear, and   its line lengths and number"
"1.3.2.5.4","6","of lines would automatically be   adjusted. He showed how this"
"1.3.2.5.4","7","was useful in displaying parallel   or counter arguments--"
"1.3.2.5.4","8","although he said that actual use of   this feature was a bit"
"1.3.2.5.4","9","more sophisticated--by squeezing each   into half width and"
"1.3.2.5.4","10","putting them side by side (with a vertical   line suddenly"
"1.3.2.5.4","11","separating them). One of the sections of text   was about a"
"1.3.2.5.4","12","third longer than the other--but two quick strokes   with Joe's"
"1.3.2.5.4","13","left hand caused the computer to adjust the display"
"1.3.2.5.4","14","automatically. The middle separator line was moved toward the"
"1.3.2.5.4","15","shorter piece of text, and the line lengths of the two"
"1.3.2.5.4","16","sections were adjusted so that they occupied the same length"
"1.3.2.5.4","17","along the dlsplay frame. Yes, you were beginning to get a feel"
"1.3.2.5.4","18","for what the expression &quot;flexible new methods for"
"1.3.2.5.4","19","manipulating   symbol structures&quot; might really imply, at"
"1.3.2.5.4","20","least on this   basic-capability level."
"1.3.2.6","1","4. Structuring an Argument"
"1.3.2.6.1","1","&quot;If we want to go on to a   higher-level capability to give"
"1.3.2.6.1","2","you a feeling for how our   rebuilt capability hierarchy works,"
"1.3.2.6.1","3","it will speed us along to   look at how we might organize these"
"1.3.2.6.1","4","more primitive   capabilities which I have demonstrated into"
"1.3.2.6.1","5","some new and   better ways to set up what we can call an"
"1.3.2.6.1","6","'argument.' This   refers loosely to any set of statements"
"1.3.2.6.1","7","(we'll call them   'product statements') that represents the"
"1.3.2.6.1","8","product of a period   of work toward a given objective."
"1.3.2.6.1","9","Confused? Well, take the   simple case where an argument leads"
"1.3.2.6.1","10","to a single product   statement. For instance, you come to a"
"1.3.2.6.1","11","particular point in   your work where you have to decide what to"
"1.3.2.6.1","12","do for the next   step. You go through some reasoning process--"
"1.3.2.6.1","13","usually involving   statements--and come up with a statement"
"1.3.2.6.1","14","specifying that next   step. That final statement is the product"
"1.3.2.6.1","15","statement, and it   represents the product of the argument or"
"1.3.2.6.1","16","reasoning process   which led to it."
"1.3.2.6.2","1","&quot;You usually think of an argument as   a serial sequence of"
"1.3.2.6.2","2","steps of reason, beginning with known   facts, assumptions,"
"1.3.2.6.2","3","etc., and progressing toward a   conclusion. Well, we do have to"
"1.3.2.6.2","4","think through these steps   serially, and we usually do list the"
"1.3.2.6.2","5","steps serially when we   write them out because that is pretty"
"1.3.2.6.2","6","much the way our papers   and books have to present them--they"
"1.3.2.6.2","7","are pretty limiting in   the symbol structuring they enable us"
"1.3.2.6.2","8","to use. Have you even   seen a 'scrambled-text' programmed"
"1.3.2.6.2","9","instruction book? That is   an interesting example of a"
"1.3.2.6.2","10","deviation from straight serial   presentation of steps."
"1.3.2.6.3","1","&quot;Conceptually speaking, however, an   argument is not a"
"1.3.2.6.3","2","serial affair.  It is sequential, I grant   you, because some"
"1.3.2.6.3","3","statements have to follow others, but this   doesn't imply that"
"1.3.2.6.3","4","its nature is necessarily serial. We   usually string Statement"
"1.3.2.6.3","5","B after Statement A, with Statements   C, D, E, F, and so on"
"1.3.2.6.3","6","following in that order--this is a   serial structuring of our"
"1.3.2.6.3","7","symbols.  Perhaps each statement   logically followed from all"
"1.3.2.6.3","8","those which preceded it on the   serial list, and if so, then"
"1.3.2.6.3","9","the conceptual structuring would   also be serial in nature, and"
"1.3.2.6.3","10","it would be nicely matched for   us by the symbol structuring."
"1.3.2.6.4","1","&quot;But a more typical case might find A   to be an"
"1.3.2.6.4","2","independent statement, B dependent upon A, C and D"
"1.3.2.6.4","3","independent, E depending upon D and B, E dependent upon C, and"
"1.3.2.6.4","4","F dependent upon A, D, and E. See, sequential but not serial?"
"1.3.2.6.4","5","A conceptual network but not a conceptual chain. The old paper"
"1.3.2.6.4","6","and pencil methods of manipulating symbols just weren't very"
"1.3.2.6.4","7","adaptable to making and using symbol structures to match the"
"1.3.2.6.4","8","ways we make and use conceptual structures.  With the new"
"1.3.2.6.4","9","symbol-manipulating methods here, we have terrific flexibility"
"1.3.2.6.4","10","for matching the two, and boy, it really pays off in the way"
"1.3.2.6.4","11","you can tie into your work."
"1.3.2.6.5","1","This makes you recall dimly the   generalizations you had heard"
"1.3.2.6.5","2","previously about process   structuring limiting symbol"
"1.3.2.6.5","3","structuring, symbol structuring   limiting concept structuring,"
"1.3.2.6.5","4","and concept structuring limiting   mental structuring.  You nod"
"1.3.2.6.5","5","cautiously, in hopes that he will   proceed in some way that"
"1.3.2.6.5","6","will tie this kind of talk to   something from which you can get"
"1.3.2.6.5","7","the &quot;feel&quot; of what it is all   about. As it turns out,"
"1.3.2.6.5","8","that is just what he intends to   do."
"1.3.2.6.6","1","&quot;Let's actually work some   examples. You help me.&quot;"
"1.3.2.6.6","2","And you become involved in a truly   fascinating game. Joe tells"
"1.3.2.6.6","3","you that you are to develop an   argument leading to statements"
"1.3.2.6.6","4","summarizing the augmentation   means so far revealed to you for"
"1.3.2.6.6","5","doing the kind of   straight-text work usually done with a"
"1.3.2.6.6","6","pencil and eraser on a   single sheet of paper. You"
"1.3.2.6.6","7","unconsciously look for a scratch   pad before you realize that"
"1.3.2.6.6","8","he is telling you that you are   going to do this the"
"1.3.2.6.6","9","&quot;augmented way&quot; by using him and his   system--with"
"1.3.2.6.6","10","artful coaching from him. Under a bit of urging   from him, you"
"1.3.2.6.6","11","begin self-consciously to mumble some inane   statements about"
"1.3.2.6.6","12","what you have seen, what they imply, what   your doubts and"
"1.3.2.6.6","13","reservations are, etc.  He mercilessly ignores   your obvious"
"1.3.2.6.6","14","discomfort and gives you no cue to stop, until he   drops his"
"1.3.2.6.6","15","hands to his lap after he has filled five frames   with these"
"1.3.2.6.6","16","statements (the surplus filled frames disappeared   to somewhere"
"1.3.2.6.6","17","--you assume Joe knows where they went and how to   get them"
"1.3.2.6.6","18","back)."
"1.3.2.6.7","1","&quot;You notice how you wandered down   different short paths,"
"1.3.2.6.7","2","and criss-crossed yourself a few   times?&quot; You nod--"
"1.3.2.6.7","3","depressed, no defense. But he isn't needling   you. &quot;Very"
"1.3.2.6.7","4","natural development, just the way we humans always   seem to"
"1.3.2.6.7","5","start out on a task for which we aren't all primed   with"
"1.3.2.6.7","6","knowledge, method, experience, and confidence--which is   to"
"1.3.2.6.7","7","include essentially every problem of any consequence to   us. So"
"1.3.2.6.7","8","let's see how we can accommodate the human's way of   developing"
"1.3.2.6.7","9","his comprehension and his final problem   solution."
"1.3.2.6.8","1","&quot;Perhaps I should have stopped   sooner--I <i>am</i>"
"1.3.2.6.8","2","supposed to be coaching you instead of   teasing you--but I had"
"1.3.2.6.8","3","a reason. You haven't been making use   of the simple symbol-"
"1.3.2.6.8","4","manipulation means that I showed   you--other than the shorthand"
"1.3.2.6.8","5","for getting the stuff on the   screens. You started out pretty"
"1.3.2.6.8","6","much the way you might with   your typewriter or pencil. I'll"
"1.3.2.6.8","7","show you how you could have   been doing otherwise, but I want"
"1.3.2.6.8","8","you to notice first how hard   it is for a person to realize how"
"1.3.2.6.8","9","really unques tioning he is   about the way he does things."
"1.3.2.6.8","10","Somehow we implicitly view most   all of our methods as just"
"1.3.2.6.8","11","sort of 'the way things are done,   that's all.' You knew that"
"1.3.2.6.8","12","some exotic techniques were going   to be applied, and you'll"
"1.3.2.6.8","13","have to admit that you were   passively waiting for them to be"
"1.3.2.6.8","14","handed to you.&quot;"
"1.3.2.6.9","1","With a non-committal nod, you suggest   getting on with it. Joe"
"1.3.2.6.9","2","begins, &quot;You're probably waiting for   something"
"1.3.2.6.9","3","impressive. What I'm trying to prime you for,   though, is the"
"1.3.2.6.9","4","realization that the impressive new <i>tricks</i> all are based"
"1.3.2.6.9","5","upon lots of changes in the little things   you do. This"
"1.3.2.6.9","6","computerized system is used over and over and   over again to"
"1.3.2.6.9","7","help me do <i>little things</i>--where my methods and   ways of"
"1.3.2.6.9","8","handling little things are changed until, lo, they've added up"
"1.3.2.6.9","9","and suddenly I can do <i>impressive</i> new things.&quot;"
"1.3.2.6.10","1","You don't know. He's a nice enough   guy, but he sure gets"
"1.3.2.6.10","2","preachy. But the good side of your   character shows through,"
"1.3.2.6.10","3","and you realize that everything so   far <i>has</i> been about"
"1.3.2.6.10","4","little things--this is probably an   important point. You'll"
"1.3.2.6.10","5","stick with him. Okay, so what could   you have been doing to use"
"1.3.2.6.10","6","the simple tricks he had shown you   in a useful way? Joe picks"
"1.3.2.6.10","7","up the light pen, poises his other   hand over the keyset, and"
"1.3.2.6.10","8","looks at you. You didn't need the   hint, but thanks anyway, and"
"1.3.2.6.10","9","let's start rearranging and   cleaning up the work space instead"
"1.3.2.6.10","10","of just dumping more raw   material on it."
"1.3.2.6.11","1","With closer coaching now from Joe,   you start through the list"
"1.3.2.6.11","2","of statements you've made and begin   to edit, re-word, compile,"
"1.3.2.6.11","3","and delete. It's fun--&quot;put that   sentence back up here"
"1.3.2.6.11","4","between these two&quot;--and blink, it's   done.  &quot;Group"
"1.3.2.6.11","5","these four statements, indented two spaces,   under the heading"
"1.3.2.6.11","6","&quot;shorthand,&quot; and blinko, it's done. &quot;Insert"
"1.3.2.6.11","7","what I say next there, after that sentence.&quot; You dictate a"
"1.3.2.6.11","8","sentence to extend a thought that is developing, and Joe"
"1.3.2.6.11","9","effortlessly converts it into an inserted new sentence. Your"
"1.3.2.6.11","10","ideas begin to take shape, and you can continually re-work the"
"1.3.2.6.11","11","existing set of statements to keep representing the state of"
"1.3.2.6.11","12","your &quot;concept structure.&quot;"
"1.3.2.6.12","1","You are quite elated by this freedom   to juggle the record of"
"1.3.2.6.12","2","your thoughts, and by the way this   freedom allows you to"
"1.3.2.6.12","3","<i>work</i> them into shape.  You   reflected that this flexible"
"1.3.2.6.12","4","cut-and-try process really did   appear to match the way you"
"1.3.2.6.12","5","seemed to develop your   thoughts. Golly, you could be writing"
"1.3.2.6.12","6","math expressions, ad   copy, or a poem, with the same type of"
"1.3.2.6.12","7","benefit. You were ready   to tell Joe that now you saw what he"
"1.3.2.6.12","8","had been trying to tell   you about matching symbol structuring"
"1.3.2.6.12","9","to concept   structuring--when he moved on to show you a"
"1.3.2.6.12","10","succession of   other tech niques that made you realize you"
"1.3.2.6.12","11","hadn't yet gotten   the full significance of his pitch."
"1.3.2.6.13","1","So far the structure that you have   built with your symbols"
"1.3.2.6.13","2","looks just like what you might build   with pencil-and-paper"
"1.3.2.6.13","3","techniques-- only here the building is   so much easier when you"
"1.3.2.6.13","4","can trim, extend, insert, and   rearrange so freely and rapidly."
"1.3.2.6.13","5","But the same computer here   that gives us these freedoms with"
"1.3.2.6.13","6","so trivial an application of   its power, can just as easily"
"1.3.2.6.13","7","give us other simple   capabilities which we can apply to the"
"1.3.2.6.13","8","development and use of   different <i>types</i> of structure"
"1.3.2.6.13","9","from what we used to   use. But let me unfold these little"
"1.3.2.6.13","10","computer tricks as we come   to them."
"1.3.2.6.14","1","&quot;When you look at a given statement   in the middle of your"
"1.3.2.6.14","2","argument structure, there are a number   of things you want to"
"1.3.2.6.14","3","know. Let's simplify the sltuation by   saying that you might"
"1.3.2.6.14","4","ask three questions, 'What's this?',   'How come?', and 'So"
"1.3.2.6.14","5","what?' Let's take these questions one at   a time and see how"
"1.3.2.6.14","6","some changes in structuring might help a   per son answer them"
"1.3.2.6.14","7","better."
"1.3.2.6.15","1","You look at a statement and you want   to understand its"
"1.3.2.6.15","2","meaning. You are used to seeing a statement   portrayed in just"
"1.3.2.6.15","3","the manner you might hear it--as a serial   succession of words."
"1.3.2.6.15","4","But, just as with the statements within   an argument, the"
"1.3.2.6.15","5","conceptual relationship among the words of a   sentence is not"
"1.3.2.6.15","6","generally serial, and we can benefit in   matching better to the"
"1.3.2.6.15","7","conceptual structure if we can   conveniently work with cer tain"
"1.3.2.6.15","8","non-serial symbol-structuring   forms within sentences."
"1.3.2.6.16","1","&quot;Most of the structuring forms I'll   show you stem from"
"1.3.2.6.16","2","the simple capability of being able to   establish arbitrary"
"1.3.2.6.16","3","linkages between different substructures,   and of directing the"
"1.3.2.6.16","4","computer subsequently to display a set of   linked substructures"
"1.3.2.6.16","5","with any relative positioning we might   designate among the"
"1.3.2.6.16","6","different substructures. You can designate   as many different"
"1.3.2.6.16","7","kinds of links as you wish, so that you can   specify different"
"1.3.2.6.16","8","display or manipulative treatment for the   different"
"1.3.2.6.16","9","types.&quot;"
"1.3.2.6.17","1","Joe picked out one of your sentences,   and pushed the rest of"
"1.3.2.6.17","2","the text a few lines up and down from   it to isolate it. He"
"1.3.2.6.17","3","then showed you how he could make a few   strokes on the keyset"
"1.3.2.6.17","4","to designate the type of link he wanted   established, and pick"
"1.3.2.6.17","5","the two symbol structures that were to   be linked by means of"
"1.3.2.6.17","6","the light pen. He said that most links   possessed a direction,"
"1.3.2.6.17","7","i.e., they were like an arrow pointing   from one substructure"
"1.3.2.6.17","8","to another, so that in setting up a link   he must specify the"
"1.3.2.6.17","9","two substructures in a given order."
"1.3.2.6.18","1","He went to work for a moment, rapidly   setting up links within"
"1.3.2.6.18","2","your sentence.  Then he showed you how   you could get some help"
"1.3.2.6.18","3","in looking at a statement and   understanding it. &quot;Here is"
"1.3.2.6.18","4","one standard portrayal, for which I   have established a"
"1.3.2.6.18","5","computer process to do the structuring   automatically on the"
"1.3.2.6.18","6","basis of the interword links.&quot; A few   strokes on the"
"1.3.2.6.18","7","keyset and suddenly the sentence fell to   pieces--different"
"1.3.2.6.18","8","parts of it being positioned here and there,   with some lines"
"1.3.2.6.18","9","connecting them. &quot;Remember diagramming   sentences when you"
"1.3.2.6.18","10","were studying grammar? Some good methods,   plus a bit of"
"1.3.2.6.18","11","practice, and you'd be surprised how much a   diagrammatic"
"1.3.2.6.18","12","breakdown can help you to scan a complex   statement and"
"1.3.2.6.18","13","untangle it quickly."
"1.3.2.6.19","1","&quot;We have developed quite a few more   little schemes to"
"1.3.2.6.19","2","help at the statement level. I don't want to   tangle you up"
"1.3.2.6.19","3","with too much detail, though.  You can see,   probably, that"
"1.3.2.6.19","4","quick dictionary-lookup helps.&quot; He aimed at a   term with"
"1.3.2.6.19","5","the light pen and hit a few strokes on the keyset,   and the old"
"1.3.2.6.19","6","text jumped farther out of the way and the   definition appeared"
"1.3.2.6.19","7","above the diagram, with the defined term   brighter than the"
"1.3.2.6.19","8","rest of the diagram.  And he showed you also   how you could"
"1.3.2.6.19","9","link secondary phrases (or sentences) to parts   of the"
"1.3.2.6.19","10","statement for more detailed description. These   secondary"
"1.3.2.6.19","11","substructures wouldn't appear when you normally   viewed the"
"1.3.2.6.19","12","statement, but could be brought in by simple   request if you"
"1.3.2.6.19","13","wanted closer study."
"1.3.2.6.20","1","&quot;It proves to be terrifically useful   to be able to work"
"1.3.2.6.20","2","easily with statements that represent more   sophisticated and"
"1.3.2.6.20","3","complex concepts.  Sort of like being able   to use structural"
"1.3.2.6.20","4","members that are lighter and stronger--it   gives you new"
"1.3.2.6.20","5","freedom in building structures. But let's move   on--we'll come"
"1.3.2.6.20","6","back to this area later, if we have time."
"1.3.2.6.21","1","&quot;When you look at a statement and   ask, 'How come?', you"
"1.3.2.6.21","2","are used to scanning back over a serial   array of previously"
"1.3.2.6.21","3","made statements in search of an   understanding of the basis"
"1.3.2.6.21","4","upon which this statement was   made. But some of these previous"
"1.3.2.6.21","5","statements are much more   significant than others to this"
"1.3.2.6.21","6","search for understanding. Let   us use what we call 'antecedent"
"1.3.2.6.21","7","links' to point to these, and   I'll give you a basic idea of"
"1.3.2.6.21","8","how we structure an argument so   that we can quickly track down"
"1.3.2.6.21","9","the essential basis upon which   a given statement rests.&quot;"
"1.3.2.6.22","1","You helped him pick out the primary   antecedents of the"
"1.3.2.6.22","2","statement you had been studying, and he   established links to"
"1.3.2.6.22","3","them. These statements were scattered   back through the serial"
"1.3.2.6.22","4","list of statements that you had   assembled, and Joe showed you"
"1.3.2.6.22","5","how you could either brighten or   underline them to make them"
"1.3.2.6.22","6","stand out to your eye--just by   requesting the computer to do"
"1.3.2.6.22","7","this for all direct antecedents   of the designated statement."
"1.3.2.6.22","8","He told you, though, that you   soon get so you aren't very much"
"1.3.2.6.22","9","interested in seeing the   serial listing of all of the"
"1.3.2.6.22","10","statements, and he made another   request of the computer (via"
"1.3.2.6.22","11","the keyset) that eliminated all   the prior statements, except"
"1.3.2.6.22","12","the direct antecedents, from the   screen. The subject statement"
"1.3.2.6.22","13","went to the bottom of the frame,   and the antecedent statements"
"1.3.2.6.22","14","were neatly listed above it."
"1.3.2.6.23","1","Joe then had you designate an order   of &quot;importance to"
"1.3.2.6.23","2","comprehension&quot; among these statements, and   he rearranged"
"1.3.2.6.23","3","them accordingly as fast as you could choose   them. (This"
"1.3.2.6.23","4","choosing was remarkably helped by having only the   remainder"
"1.3.2.6.23","5","statements to study for each new choice--another   little"
"1.3.2.6.23","6","contribution to effectiveness, you thought.) He   mentioned that"
"1.3.2.6.23","7","you could designate orderings under several   different"
"1.3.2.6.23","8","criteria, and later have the display show whichever   ordering"
"1.3.2.6.23","9","you wished. This, he implied, could be used very   effectively"
"1.3.2.6.23","10","when you were building or studying an argument   structure in"
"1.3.2.6.23","11","which from time to time you wanted to strengthen   your"
"1.3.2.6.23","12","comprehension relative to different aspects of the   situation."
"1.3.2.6.24","1","&quot;Each primary antecedent can   similarly be linked to its"
"1.3.2.6.24","2","primary antecedents, and so on,   until you arrive at the"
"1.3.2.6.24","3","statements representing the premises,   the accepted facts, and"
"1.3.2.6.24","4","the objectives upon which this   argument had been established."
"1.3.2.6.24","5","When we had established the   antecedent links for all the"
"1.3.2.6.24","6","statements in the argument, the   question 'So what?' that you"
"1.3.2.6.24","7","might ask when looking at a given   statement would be answered"
"1.3.2.6.24","8","by looking for the statements for   which the given statement"
"1.3.2.6.24","9","was an antecedent. We already have   links to these consequents"
"1.3.2.6.24","10","--just turn around the arrows on the   antecedent links and we"
"1.3.2.6.24","11","have consequent links. So we can   easily call forth an"
"1.3.2.6.24","12","uncluttered display of consequent   statements to help us see"
"1.3.2.6.24","13","why we needed this given statement   in the argument."
"1.3.2.6.25","1","&quot;To help us get better comprehension   of the structure of"
"1.3.2.6.25","2","an argument, we can also call forth a   schematic or graphical"
"1.3.2.6.25","3","display. Once the antecedent-consequent   links have been"
"1.3.2.6.25","4","established, the computer can automatically   construct such a"
"1.3.2.6.25","5","display for us.&quot; So, Joe spent a few minutes   (with your"
"1.3.2.6.25","6","help) establishing a reasonable set of links among   the"
"1.3.2.6.25","7","statements you had originally listed.  Then another   keyed-in"
"1.3.2.6.25","8","request to the computer, and almost instantaneously   there"
"1.3.2.6.25","9","appeared a network of lines and dots that looked   something"
"1.3.2.6.25","10","like a tree--except that sometimes branches would   fuse"
"1.3.2.6.25","11","together. &quot;Each node or dot represents one of the"
"1.3.2.6.25","12","statements of your argument, and the lines are   antecedent-"
"1.3.2.6.25","13","consequent links. The antecedents of one statement   always lie"
"1.3.2.6.25","14","above that statement-- or rather, their nodes lie   above its"
"1.3.2.6.25","15","node. When you get used to using a network   representation like"
"1.3.2.6.25","16","this, it really becomes a great help in   getting the feel for"
"1.3.2.6.25","17","the way all the different ideas and   reasoning fit together--"
"1.3.2.6.25","18","that is, for the conceptual   structuring.&quot;"
"1.3.2.6.26","1","Joe demonstrated some ways in which   you could make use of the"
"1.3.2.6.26","2","diagram to study the argument   structure. Point to any node,"
"1.3.2.6.26","3","give a couple of strokes on the   keyset, and the corresponding"
"1.3.2.6.26","4","statement would appear on the   other screen--and that node"
"1.3.2.6.26","5","would become brighter. Call the   antecedents forth on the"
"1.3.2.6.26","6","second screen, and select one of   special interest--deleting"
"1.3.2.6.26","7","the others. Follow back down the   antecedent trail a little"
"1.3.2.6.26","8","further, using one screen to look at   the detail at any time,"
"1.3.2.6.26","9","and the other to show you the larger   view, with automatic"
"1.3.2.6.26","10","node-brightening indication of where   these detailed items fit"
"1.3.2.6.26","11","in the larger view."
"1.3.2.6.27","1","&quot;For a little embellishment here, and   to show off another"
"1.3.2.6.27","2","little capability in my repertoire, let me   label the nodes so"
"1.3.2.6.27","3","that you can develop more association   between the nodes and"
"1.3.2.6.27","4","the statements in the argument.  I can   do this several ways."
"1.3.2.6.27","5","For one thing, I can tell the computer   to number the"
"1.3.2.6.27","6","statements in the order in which you originally   had them"
"1.3.2.6.27","7","listed, and have the labelling done automatically.&quot;    This"
"1.3.2.6.27","8","took him a total of five strokes on the keyset, and   suddenly"
"1.3.2.6.27","9","each node was made into a circle with a number in   it. The"
"1.3.2.6.27","10","statements that were on the second screen now each had   its"
"1.3.2.6.27","11","respective serial number sitting next to it in the left"
"1.3.2.6.27","12","margin.  &quot;This helps you remember what the different nodes"
"1.3.2.6.27","13","on   the network display contain. We have also evolved some"
"1.3.2.6.27","14","handy   techniques for constructing abbreviation labels that"
"1.3.2.6.27","15","help your   memory quite a bit."
"1.3.2.6.28","1","&quot;Also, we can display extra   fine-structure and labelling"
"1.3.2.6.28","2","detail within the network in the   specific local area we happen"
"1.3.2.6.28","3","to be concentrating upon. This   finer detail is washed out as"
"1.3.2.6.28","4","we move to another spot with our   close attention, and the"
"1.3.2.6.28","5","coarser remaining structure is   compressed, so that there is"
"1.3.2.6.28","6","room for our new spot to be blown   up. It is a lot like using"
"1.3.2.6.28","7","zones of variable magnification as   you scan the structure--"
"1.3.2.6.28","8","higher magnification where you are   inspecting detail, lower"
"1.3.2.6.28","9","magnification in the surrounding   field so that your feel for"
"1.3.2.6.28","10","the whole structure and where you   are in it can stay with"
"1.3.2.6.28","11","you.&quot;"
"1.3.2.7","1","5. General Symbol Structuring"
"1.3.2.7.1","1","&quot;If you are tangling with a problem   of any size--whether"
"1.3.2.7.1","2","it involves you for half an hour or two   years--the entire"
"1.3.2.7.1","3","collection of statements, sketches,   computations, literature"
"1.3.2.7.1","4","sources, and source extracts that is   associated with your work"
"1.3.2.7.1","5","would in our minds constitute a   single symbol structure. There"
"1.3.2.7.1","6","may be many levels of   substructuring between the level of"
"1.3.2.7.1","7","individual symbols and   that represented by the entire"
"1.3.2.7.1","8","collection. You and I have been   worxing with some of the"
"1.3.2.7.1","9","lower-ordered substructures--the   individual statements and the"
"1.3.2.7.1","10","multistatement argu ments--and   have skimmed through some of"
"1.3.2.7.1","11","the ways to build and manipulate   them. The results of small"
"1.3.2.7.1","12","arguments are usually integrated in   a higher level network of"
"1.3.2.7.1","13","argument or concept development, and   these into still higher-"
"1.3.2.7.1","14","level networks, and so on. But at any   such level, the manner"
"1.3.2.7.1","15","in which the interrelationship between   the kernels of argument"
"1.3.2.7.1","16","can be tagged, portrayed, studied and   manipulated is much the"
"1.3.2.7.1","17","same as those which we have just been   through."
"1.3.2.7.2","1","&quot;Substructures that might represent   mathematical or"
"1.3.2.7.2","2","formal-logic arguments may be linked right in   with"
"1.3.2.7.2","3","substructures composed of the more informal   statements."
"1.3.2.7.2","4","Substructures that represent graphs, curves,   engineering"
"1.3.2.7.2","5","drawings, and other graphical forms can likewise   be"
"1.3.2.7.2","6","integrated. One can also append special substructures, of   any"
"1.3.2.7.2","7","size, to particular other substructures.  A frequent use   of"
"1.3.2.7.2","8","this is to append descriptive material--something like"
"1.3.2.7.2","9","footnotes, only much more flexible. Or, special messages can"
"1.3.2.7.2","10","be hung on that offer ideas such as simplifying an argument or"
"1.3.2.7.2","11","circumventing a blocked path--to be uncovered and considered"
"1.3.2.7.2","12","at some later date. These different appended substructures can"
"1.3.2.7.2","13","remain invisible to the worker until such time as he wants to"
"1.3.2.7.2","14","flush them into view. He can ask for the cue symbols that"
"1.3.2.7.2","15","indicate their presence (identifying where they are linked and"
"1.3.2.7.2","16","what their respective types are) to be shown on the network"
"1.3.2.7.2","17","display any time he wishes, and then call up whichever of them"
"1.3.2.7.2","18","he wishes If he is interested in only one type of appended"
"1.3.2.7.2","19","substructure, he can request that only the cues associated"
"1.3.2.7.2","20","with that type be displayed."
"1.3.2.7.3","1","&quot;You should also realize that a   substructure doesn't have"
"1.3.2.7.3","2","to be a hunk of data sitting neatly   distinct within the normal"
"1.3.2.7.3","3","form of the larger structure. One   can choose from a symbol"
"1.3.2.7.3","4","structure (or substructure,   generally) any arbitrary"
"1.3.2.7.3","5","collection of its substructures,   designate any arbitrary"
"1.3.2.7.3","6","structuring among these and any new   substructures he wants to"
"1.3.2.7.3","7","add, and thus define a new   substructure which the computer can"
"1.3.2.7.3","8","untangle from the larger   structure and present to him at any"
"1.3.2.7.3","9","time. The associative   trails that Bush suggested represent a"
"1.3.2.7.3","10","primitive example of   this. A good deal of this type of"
"1.3.2.7.3","11","activity is involved during   the early, shifting development of"
"1.3.2.7.3","12","some phase of work, as you   saw when you were collecting"
"1.3.2.7.3","13","tentative argument chains. But   here again, we find ever more"
"1.3.2.7.3","14","delightful ways to make use of   the straightforward-seeming"
"1.3.2.7.3","15","capabilities in developing new   higher-level capabilities--"
"1.3.2.7.3","16","which, of course, seem sort of   straight forward by then, too."
"1.3.2.7.4","1","&quot;I found, when I learned to work with   the structures and"
"1.3.2.7.4","2","manipulation processes such as we have   outlined, that I got"
"1.3.2.7.4","3","rather impatient if I had to go back to   dealing with the"
"1.3.2.7.4","4","serial-statement structuring in books and   journals, or other"
"1.3.2.7.4","5","ordinary means of communicating with other   workers.  It is"
"1.3.2.7.4","6","rather like having to project   three-dimensional images onto"
"1.3.2.7.4","7","two-dimensional frames and to   work with them there instead of"
"1.3.2.7.4","8","in their natural   form. Actually, it is much closer to the"
"1.3.2.7.4","9","truth to say that it   is like trying to project n-dimensional"
"1.3.2.7.4","10","forms (the concept   structures, which we have seen can be"
"1.3.2.7.4","11","related with many many   nonintersecting links) onto a one-"
"1.3.2.7.4","12","dimensional form (the serial   string of symbols), where the"
"1.3.2.7.4","13","human memory and visualization   has to hold and picture the"
"1.3.2.7.4","14","links and relationships. I guess   that's a natural feeling,"
"1.3.2.7.4","15","though. One gets impatlent any tlme   he is forced into a"
"1.3.2.7.4","16","restrlcted or primitive mode of   operation--except perhaps for"
"1.3.2.7.4","17","recreatlonal purposes."
"1.3.2.7.5","1","&quot;I'm sure that you've had the   experience of working over"
"1.3.2.7.5","2","a journal article to get   comprehension and perhaps some"
"1.3.2.7.5","3","special-purpose conclusions   that you can integrate into your"
"1.3.2.7.5","4","own work. Well, when you ever   get handy at roaming over the"
"1.3.2.7.5","5","type of symbol structure which   we have been showing here, and"
"1.3.2.7.5","6","you turn for this purpose to   another person's work that is"
"1.3.2.7.5","7","structured in this way, you will   find a terrific difference"
"1.3.2.7.5","8","there in the ease of gaining   comprehension as to what he has"
"1.3.2.7.5","9","done and why he has done it,   and of isolating what you want to"
"1.3.2.7.5","10","use and making sure of the   conditions under which you can use"
"1.3.2.7.5","11","it. This is true even if   you find his structure left in the"
"1.3.2.7.5","12","condition in which he has   been working on it--that is, with no"
"1.3.2.7.5","13","special provisions for   helping an outsider find his way"
"1.3.2.7.5","14","around. But we have learned   quite a few simple tricks for"
"1.3.2.7.5","15","leaving appended road signs,   supplementary information,"
"1.3.2.7.5","16","questions, and auxiliary links on   our working structures--in"
"1.3.2.7.5","17","such a manner that they never get   in our way as we work--so"
"1.3.2.7.5","18","that the visitor to our structure   can gain his comprehension"
"1.3.2.7.5","19","and isolate what he wants in   marvelously short order. Some of"
"1.3.2.7.5","20","these techniques are quite   closely related to those used in"
"1.3.2.7.5","21","automated-instruction   programming--perhaps you know about"
"1.3.2.7.5","22","'teaching machines?'"
"1.3.2.7.6","1","&quot;What we found ourselves doing, when   having to do any"
"1.3.2.7.6","2","extensive digesting of journal articles, was   to type large"
"1.3.2.7.6","3","batches of the text verbatim into computer   store. It is so"
"1.3.2.7.6","4","nice to be able to tear it apart, establish   our own"
"1.3.2.7.6","5","definitions and substitute, restructure, append notes,   and so"
"1.3.2.7.6","6","forth, in pursuit of comprehension, that it was   generally well"
"1.3.2.7.6","7","worth the trouble.  The keyset shorthand made   this reasonably"
"1.3.2.7.6","8","practical. But the project now has an optical   character reader"
"1.3.2.7.6","9","that will convert our external references   into machine code"
"1.3.2.7.6","10","for us. The references are available for   study in original"

"1.3.2.7.6","12","done by a previous reader, or   ourselves, can also be utilized."
"1.3.2.7.7","1","&quot;A number of us here are using the   augmented systems for"
"1.3.2.7.7","2","our project research, and we find that   after a few passes"
"1.3.2.7.7","3","through a reference, we very rarely go back   to it in its"
"1.3.2.7.7","4","original form. It sits in the archives like an   orange rind,"
"1.3.2.7.7","5","with most of the real juice squeezed out. The   contributions"
"1.3.2.7.7","6","from these references form sturdy members of our   structure,"
"1.3.2.7.7","7","and are duly tagged as to source so that   acknowledgment is"
"1.3.2.7.7","8","always implicitly noted.  The analysis and   digestion that any"
"1.3.2.7.7","9","of us makes on such a reference is fully   available to the"
"1.3.2.7.7","10","others. It is rather amazing how much   superfluous verbiage is"
"1.3.2.7.7","11","contained in those papers merely to   try to make up for the"
"1.3.2.7.7","12","pitifully sparse possibilities   available for symbol"

"1.3.2.8.1","1","There was a slight pause while Joe   apparently was reflecting"
"1.3.2.8.1","2","upon something.  He started to   speak, thought differently of"
"1.3.2.8.1","3","it, and turned to flash   something on a screen. You looked"
"1.3.2.8.1","4","quickly, anticipating that   now you would comprehend.  Well,"
"1.3.2.8.1","5","more of the display looked   meaningful to you than when you had"
"1.3.2.8.1","6","first watched him going   about his work, but you realized that"
"1.3.2.8.1","7","you were still a bit   uneducated. I've developed a sequence for"
"1.3.2.8.1","8","presenting the   different basic features of our augmentation"
"1.3.2.8.1","9","system that seems   to work pretty well, and I just wanted to be"
"1.3.2.8.1","10","sure I was still   following it reasonably closely.&quot;"
"1.3.2.8.2","1","He noticed you wrinkle your face as   you looked at the display."
"1.3.2.8.2","2","&quot;It's time to shift the topic a   bit, and some of the"
"1.3.2.8.2","3","things on the screen that are probably   puzzling you can make a"
"1.3.2.8.2","4","starting point for a new discussion   phase. See, when I"
"1.3.2.8.2","5","outlined a delivery for giving a feel for   these techniques to"
"1.3.2.8.2","6","the uninitiated, I could have sketched out   the subject matter"
"1.3.2.8.2","7","in a skeletal argument structure. From what   we've been through"
"1.3.2.8.2","8","so far, you might expect it to be like   that. What I did,"
"1.3.2.8.2","9","though, was to treat the matter as a process   that I was going"
"1.3.2.8.2","10","to execute the process of giving you a   lecture demonstration."
"1.3.2.8.2","11","It is a rather trivial exercise of the   techniques we have for"
"1.3.2.8.2","12","developing and manipulating processes,   but anyway that's the"
"1.3.2.8.2","13","form I chose for making the notes."
"1.3.2.8.3","1","&quot;A process is something that is   designed, built, and used"
"1.3.2.8.3","2","--as is any tool. In the general   sense in which we consider"
"1.3.2.8.3","3","processes to be a part of our   augmentatlon system, it is"
"1.3.2.8.3","4","absolutely necessary that there be   effective capability for"
"1.3.2.8.3","5","designing and building processes as   well as for using them."
"1.3.2.8.3","6","For one thing, the laying out of   objectives and a method of"
"1.3.2.8.3","7","approach for a problem represent a   form of process design and"
"1.3.2.8.3","8","building, to our way of looking at   it. And an independent"
"1.3.2.8.3","9","problem solver certainly has to have   this capability. Indeed,"
"1.3.2.8.3","10","we find that designing and   coordinating one's sequence of"
"1.3.2.8.3","11","steps, in high levels or in low   levels of such <i>process"
"1.3.2.8.3","12","structuring</i>, is an extremely   important part of the total"
"1.3.2.8.3","13","activity."
"1.3.2.8.4","1","&quot;One of our research guys in the   early phases of our"
"1.3.2.8.4","2","augmentation development was considered   (then) to be a bug on"
"1.3.2.8.4","3","this topic. He maintained that about ten   percent of the little"
"1.3.2.8.4","4","steps we took all day accounted for   ninety percent of the"
"1.3.2.8.4","5","progress toward the goals we claimed to   pursue--that is, that"
"1.3.2.8.4","6","ninety percent of our actions and   thoughts were coupled to our"
"1.3.2.8.4","7","net progress in only a very   feeble way. Well, we can't analyze"
"1.3.2.8.4","8","the old ways of doing   things very accurately to check his"
"1.3.2.8.4","9","estimated figures, but we   certainly have come to be in general"
"1.3.2.8.4","10","sympathy with his   stand. We have developed quite a few"
"1.3.2.8.4","11","concepts and methods for   using the computer system to help us"
"1.3.2.8.4","12","plan and supervise   sophisticated courses of action, to monitor"
"1.3.2.8.4","13","and evaluate what   we do, and to use this information as direct"
"1.3.2.8.4","14","feedback for   modifying our planning techniques in the future."
"1.3.2.8.5","1","&quot;There are, of course, the explicit   computer processes"
"1.3.2.8.5","2","which we use, and which our philosophy   requires the augmented"
"1.3.2.8.5","3","man to be able to design and build for   himself. A number of"
"1.3.2.8.5","4","people, outside our research group here,   maintain stoutly that"
"1.3.2.8.5","5","a practical augmentation system should   not require the human"
"1.3.2.8.5","6","to have to do any computer   programming--they feel that this is"
"1.3.2.8.5","7","too specialized a   capability to burden people with. Well, what"
"1.3.2.8.5","8","that means in our   eyes, if translated to a home workshop,"
"1.3.2.8.5","9","would be like saying   that you can't require the operating"
"1.3.2.8.5","10","human to know how to   adjust his tools, or set up jigs, or"
"1.3.2.8.5","11","change drill sizes, and   the like. You can see there that these"
"1.3.2.8.5","12","skllls are easy to   learn in the context of what the human has"
"1.3.2.8.5","13","to learn anyway   about using the tools, and that they provide"
"1.3.2.8.5","14","for much greater   flexibility in finding convenient ways to use"
"1.3.2.8.5","15","the tools to   help shape materials."
"1.3.2.8.6","1","&quot;It won't take too much time to give you a feel for the"
"1.3.2.8.6","2","helpful methods we have for working on   computer-process"
"1.3.2.8.6","3","structures -- or programs -- because there is   quite a bit of"
"1.3.2.8.6","4","similarity in concept to what you have seen in   the symbol-"
"1.3.2.8.6","5","structuring techniques. No matter what <i>language</i> you use"
"1.3.2.8.6","6","-- whether machine language, list language, or   ALGOL, for"
"1.3.2.8.6","7","instance--you build up the required process   structure by"
"1.3.2.8.6","8","organizing statements in that language. Each   statement"
"1.3.2.8.6","9","specifies a given process to your computer. Well,   you have"
"1.3.2.8.6","10","already seen how you can get help in developing   precise and"
"1.3.2.8.6","11","powerful statements, or in gaining quick   comprehension of"
"1.3.2.8.6","12","state ments, by charting or diagramming them and using special"
"1.3.2.8.6","13","links between the different parts.  &quot;Look   here.'&quot;"
"1.3.2.8.6","14","And he went after what he said was a typical process"
"1.3.2.8.6","15","structure, to give you an example of what he was talking"
"1.3.2.8.6","16","about. In several brief, successive frame displays, before he"
"1.3.2.8.6","17","got to the one he wanted, you got glimpses of network"
"1.3.2.8.6","18","schematics that reminded you of those used in symbol"
"1.3.2.8.6","19","structuring. But, what he finally had on the display frame was"
"1.3.2.8.6","20","quite different from the argument statements you had seen."
"1.3.2.8.7","1","&quot;In explaining symbol-structuring to   you, I used the"
"1.3.2.8.7","2","likely questions, 'What's this?' 'How come?'    and 'So what?'"
"1.3.2.8.7","3","to point out the usefulness of some of our   structuring"
"1.3.2.8.7","4","methods. Here, in process structuring,   corresponding questions"
"1.3.2.8.7","5","about a statement might be: 'What does   it say to do?' 'What"
"1.3.2.8.7","6","effect will that have?' and 'Why do we   want that done?' Let's"
"1.3.2.8.7","7","take a quick look at some of the ways   you can get help in"
"1.3.2.8.7","8","answering them."
"1.3.2.8.8","1","&quot;The language used to compose these   process-description"
"1.3.2.8.8","2","stateme for the computer is considerably   more compact and"
"1.3.2.8.8","3","precise than is a natural language, such as   English, and there"
"1.3.2.8.8","4","is correspondingly less advantage to be   gained by appending"
"1.3.2.8.8","5","special links and tags for giving us   humans a better grasp of"
"1.3.2.8.8","6","their meaning. However, as you see in   this left-hand section"
"1.3.2.8.8","7","of the statement portrayal, geometrical   grouping, linking, and"
"1.3.2.8.8","8","positioning of the statement components   are used in the blown-"
"1.3.2.8.8","9","up statement display.  But this   portrayal doesn't stem from"
"1.3.2.8.8","10","special appended information, it   can be laid out like this"
"1.3.2.8.8","11","automatically by the computer, just   from the cues it gets from"
"1.3.2.8.8","12","the necessary symbol components of   the statement. The"
"1.3.2.8.8","13","different significant relationships are   more perceptible to a"
"1.3.2.8.8","14","human in this way of laying it out, and   an experienced human"
"1.3.2.8.8","15","thus gets quite a bit of help in   answering the first question:"
"1.3.2.8.8","16","'What does it say to do?'"
"1.3.2.8.9","1","For the second question, relative to   what effect the specified"
"1.3.2.8.9","2","action will have, some of these   symbols to the right give you"
"1.3.2.8.9","3","a quick story about the very   detailed and immediate effect on"
"1.3.2.8.9","4","the state of the symbol   structure which this process structure"
"1.3.2.8.9","5","is manipulating. Other   symbols here provide keys which a"
"1.3.2.8.9","6","light-pen selection can   activate to bring to you displays of"
"1.3.2.8.9","7","that symbol structure,   usually a choice of several relevant"
"1.3.2.8.9","8","views at different levels   of the structure. Then I can use the"
"1.3.2.8.9","9","keyset to ask for the   preceding statement, if I'm a little"
"1.3.2.8.9","10","puzzled about the   detailed manipulation--or, I can request a"
"1.3.2.8.9","11","specific   higher-level view of the process structure by light-"
"1.3.2.8.9","12","pen   selection on one of these remaining symbols here."
"1.3.2.8.10","1","So saying, Joe selected one of these   symbols with his pen, and"
"1.3.2.8.10","2","a new and different display popped   into view. &quot;This is"
"1.3.2.8.10","3","the next level up in the process   structure. It consists of"
"1.3.2.8.10","4","lists of compactly abbreviated   statements, and some condensed"
"1.3.2.8.10","5","notes about their effects. If   we want, we can blow up one at a"
"1.3.2.8.10","6","time as we study over the   list. In this context, one can get"
"1.3.2.8.10","7","some answer to the larger   picture of what effect will a given"
"1.3.2.8.10","8","statement have, and also   some answer to the question about why"
"1.3.2.8.10","9","we want a given effect   produced. But this is a sort of a"
"1.3.2.8.10","10","holdover from old pro   gramming habits, and most of us nowadays"
"1.3.2.8.10","11","are making   considerably more use of the schematic techniques"
"1.3.2.8.10","12","that evolved   out of the program flow-charting techniques and"
"1.3.2.8.10","13","out of our   symbol-structuring techniques."
"1.3.2.8.11","1","&quot;I know that you have less prevlous   familiarity with the"
"1.3.2.8.11","2","nature of programs than you do wlth the   nature of arguments,"
"1.3.2.8.11","3","so I'll just give you a few quick views   of what these process-"
"1.3.2.8.11","4","structure schematic portrayals look   like, and not try to"
"1.3.2.8.11","5","explain them in any detail. He flashed a   few on the screen,"
"1.3.2.8.11","6","and indicated how some of the different   features could give"
"1.3.2.8.11","7","the human a quick appreclation of how   different component"
"1.3.2.8.11","8","processes were cooperating to produce a   more sophisticated"
"1.3.2.8.11","9","process. You could appreciate some of the   tricks of linking in"
"1.3.2.8.11","10","explanatory and descriptive substructure   and the general means"
"1.3.2.8.11","11","of using all the different   symbol-structuring tricks for"
"1.3.2.8.11","12","representing to the human the   considerations, critical"
"1.3.2.8.11","13","features, and lnterdependencies   involved in the process"
"1.3.2.8.11","14","structure."
"1.3.2.8.12","1","&quot;Most of this portrayal technique   actually represents"
"1.3.2.8.12","2","special structuring of what we previously   defined in a loose"
"1.3.2.8.12","3","way as arguments. The human who wants to   approach an"
"1.3.2.8.12","4","established process structure in order to modify   it, needs to"
"1.3.2.8.12","5","gain comprehension of the relevant features both   of the"
"1.3.2.8.12","6","functioning and of the design of the structure. You saw   how"
"1.3.2.8.12","7","this could be facilitated by our symbol-structuring"
"1.3.2.8.12","8","techniques. And if he is building a new process structure or"
"1.3.2.8.12","9","changing an existing one, he needs to structure the argument"
"1.3.2.8.12","10","or reasoning behind the design. We have developed a number of"
"1.3.2.8.12","11","special symbol-structuring techniques that allow us to match"
"1.3.2.8.12","12","especially well to the concepts involved in designing"
"1.3.2.8.12","13","processes."
"1.3.2.8.13","1","&quot;But there is a very significant   feature involved in this"
"1.3.2.8.13","2","particular type of process   structuring that I should tell you"
"1.3.2.8.13","3","about. It is based upon the   fact that the process-description"
"1.3.2.8.13","4","language for the computer is   formal and precise. Because of"
"1.3.2.8.13","5","this fact, we can establish   explicit rules for treating"
"1.3.2.8.13","6","statements in this language, and   for treating symbol"
"1.3.2.8.13","7","structures composed of these statements,   such that computer"
"1.3.2.8.13","8","pro cesses based upon these rules can be   said to extract"
"1.3.2.8.13","9","meaning from these statements and to do   operations based upon"
"1.3.2.8.13","10","this meaning. The result is that the   computer is able to find"
"1.3.2.8.13","11","answers to a much wider range of   questions about a specified"
"1.3.2.8.13","12","process structure than it could if   only the structural"
"1.3.2.8.13","13","characteristics were discernible to   it."
"1.3.2.8.14","1","&quot;In our studying and designing   process structures, we"
"1.3.2.8.14","2","have found many ways to capitalize upon   this more"
"1.3.2.8.14","3","sophisticated question-answering capability now   possessed by"
"1.3.2.8.14","4","the computer. We are learning, for instance, how   to get the"
"1.3.2.8.14","5","computer to decide whether or not some types of   design"
"1.3.2.8.14","6","specificatlons are met, and if not, where the   limitation"
"1.3.2.8.14","7","exists. Or, perhaps we approach an already designed   process"
"1.3.2.8.14","8","structure which we think we can modify, or from which   we can"
"1.3.2.8.14","9","extract some useful sub-process that we contemplate"
"1.3.2.8.14","10","incorporating into another process we are designing. We are"
"1.3.2.8.14","11","getting terrific help in this type of instance, since we can"
"1.3.2.8.14","12","now ask the computer direct questions about types of"
"1.3.2.8.14","13","capability and limitation in this structure. The computer can"
"1.3.2.8.14","14","even lead us directly to the particular design features from"
"1.3.2.8.14","15","which these capabilities or limitations stem, and it is simple"
"1.3.2.8.14","16","then to examine the descriptive and explanatory arguments"
"1.3.2.8.14","17","linked thereto in order to see why these features were"
"1.3.2.8.14","18","designed into the structure."
"1.3.2.8.15","1","&quot;But I don't want to spend a   disproportionate amount of"
"1.3.2.8.15","2","time on the computer processes. The   augmented man is engaged"
"1.3.2.8.15","3","more often in structuring what we   call composite processes"
"1.3.2.8.15","4","than he is in structuring computer   processes.  For instance,"
"1.3.2.8.15","5","planning a research project, or a   day's work, are examples of"
"1.3.2.8.15","6","structuring composite processes. A   composite process,"
"1.3.2.8.15","7","remember, is organized from both human   processes and computer"
"1.3.2.8.15","8","processes--which includes, of course,   the possible inclusion"
"1.3.2.8.15","9","of lower-order composite processes. The   structuring here"
"1.3.2.8.15","10","differs from that of a computer process   mainly in the"
"1.3.2.8.15","11","sophistication of the sub-processes which can be"
"1.3.2.8.15","12","<i>specified</i> for the human to do. Some of these"
"1.3.2.8.15","13","specifications have to be given in a language which matches the"
"1.3.2.8.15","14","human's rich working framework of concepts--and we have been"
"1.3.2.8.15","15","demonstrating here with English for that purpose--but quite a"
"1.3.2.8.15","16","few   human-executed processes can be specified in the   high-"
"1.3.2.8.15","17","level computer-processing language even though we don't   know"
"1.3.2.8.15","18","how to <i>describe</i> them in that language.  This means   that"
"1.3.2.8.15","19","there few composite-process structures about which the"
"1.3.2.8.15","20","computer can answer very useful questions for us."
"1.3.2.8.16","1","&quot;But to be more specific--we find   that setting up"
"1.3.2.8.16","2","objectives, deslgning a method of approach,   and then"
"1.3.2.8.16","3","implementing that method are of course our   fundamental"
"1.3.2.8.16","4","operating sequence--done over and over again in   the many"
"1.3.2.8.16","5","levels of our activity. We mentioned above what the"
"1.3.2.8.16","6","characteristic structural difference was between computer"
"1.3.2.8.16","7","processes and composite processes. But perhaps more important"
"1.3.2.8.16","8","to us is the difference in the way we work with   composite-"
"1.3.2.8.16","9","process structures. Here is a crude but succinct way   to put"
"1.3.2.8.16","10","this.  With the human contributing to a process, we   find more"
"1.3.2.8.16","11","and more as the process becomes complex that the   value of the"
"1.3.2.8.16","12","human's contribution depends upon how much   freedom he is given"
"1.3.2.8.16","13","to be disorderly in his course of action.   For instance, we"
"1.3.2.8.16","14","provide him as much help as possible in   making a plan of"
"1.3.2.8.16","15","action. Then we give him as much help as we   can in carrying it"
"1.3.2.8.16","16","out.  But we also have to allow him to   change his mind at"
"1.3.2.8.16","17","almost any point, and to want to modify his   plans. So, we"
"1.3.2.8.16","18","provide augmentation help to him for keeping   track of his"
"1.3.2.8.16","19","plans where he is in them, what has been   happening in carrying"
"1.3.2.8.16","20","them out to date--and for evaluating   possibilities that might"
"1.3.2.8.16","21","occur to him for changing the   plans. In fact, we are even"
"1.3.2.8.16","22","learning how the computer can be   made to watch for some kinds"
"1.3.2.8.16","23","of plan-change possibilities, and   to point them out to the"
"1.3.2.8.16","24","human when they arise."
"1.3.2.8.17","1","&quot;Here's a simple example of this sort   of help for the"
"1.3.2.8.17","2","human. Last winter, we designed a computer   process that can"
"1.3.2.8.17","3","automatically monitor the occurrence of   specified types of"
"1.3.2.8.17","4","computer usage over a specified period of   time, and which,"
"1.3.2.8.17","5","from the resulting data, can deduce a   surprising amount of"
"1.3.2.8.17","6","information regarding how the human made   use of that time."
"1.3.2.8.17","7","This was quite helpful to us for evaluating   our ways of doing"
"1.3.2.8.17","8","things. Then we added more features to the   program, in which"
"1.3.2.8.17","9","the computer occasionally interrupts the   human's activity and"
"1.3.2.8.17","10","displays some questions to be   answered. From these answers,"
"1.3.2.8.17","11","together with its normal   monitoring data, the program can"
"1.3.2.8.17","12","provide evaluative data   regarding the relative success of his"
"1.3.2.8.17","13","different work methods.   Our augmentation researchers became"
"1.3.2.8.17","14","intrigued by this angle   and bore down a little on it. They"
"1.3.2.8.17","15","came up with a package   process which gives the human many"
"1.3.2.8.17","16","different types of feedback   about his progress and way of"
"1.3.2.8.17","17","doing things.  Now, as part of   my regular practice, I spend"
"1.3.2.8.17","18","about five minutes out of each   hour exercising with this"
"1.3.2.8.17","19","package. This almost always reveals   things to me that change"
"1.3.2.8.17","20","at least the slant of my approach   during the next hour, and"
"1.3.2.8.17","21","often stimulates a relatlvely   significant change in my short-"
"1.3.2.8.17","22","range plans"
"1.3.2.8.18","1","&quot;You appreciate, of course, that I   accomplish many more"
"1.3.2.8.18","2","meaningful steps in an hour now than I   used to, or than would"
"1.3.2.8.18","3","be your norm now. This once-an-hour   review for me now might"
"1.3.2.8.18","4","compare with a once-a-day review for   you, as far as the"
"1.3.2.8.18","5","distance travelled between reviews is   concerned."
"1.3.2.8.19","1","&quot;Our way of structuring the statement   of our objectives,"
"1.3.2.8.19","2","the arguments which lead to the design of   our plans, and the"
"1.3.2.8.19","3","working statements of our plans, has been   influenced by this"
"1.3.2.8.19","4","review process. We found special types of   tags and descriptive"
"1.3.2.8.19","5","codes which we could append to these   respective planning"
"1.3.2.8.19","6","structures as we developed them which   later facilitated our"
"1.3.2.8.19","7","man-computer cooperative review of   them. Also, our methods of"
"1.3.2.8.19","8","developing these structures have   evolved to facilitate their"
"1.3.2.8.19","9","later modification. For instance,   every basic consideration"
"1.3.2.8.19","10","upon which a given planning   statement is based is linked to"
"1.3.2.8.19","11","that statement as a matter of   standard argument structuring."
"1.3.2.8.19","12","But we have taken to linking   special tagging codes into these"
"1.3.2.8.19","13","argument structures involving   our planning, to identify for"
"1.3.2.8.19","14","the computer some of the   different types of dependency"
"1.3.2.8.19","15","relationships in the antecedent   linkages. Later, if we"
"1.3.2.8.19","16","consider changing the plan, these   special tags often enable us"
"1.3.2.8.19","17","to make use of some special   computer processes that"
"1.3.2.8.19","18","automatically isolate the   considerations relevant to a"
"1.3.2.8.19","19","particular type of change we have   in mind."
"1.3.2.8.20","1","&quot;Maybe an example will help   here. There is a plan I am"
"1.3.2.8.20","2","currently using for the way I go   about entering miscellaneous"
"1.3.2.8.20","3","scraps of infcrmation lnto my   total symbol structure. It is"
"1.3.2.8.20","4","designed so that there will be a   good chance for these scraps"
"1.3.2.8.20","5","later to be usefully   integrated. It turns out that this plan"
"1.3.2.8.20","6","is closely coupled in   its design argument to the general plan"
"1.3.2.8.20","7","for reviewing process   structures--and symbol-structures, too,"
"1.3.2.8.20","8","for that   matter. Recently, I got an idea as to how I might add"
"1.3.2.8.20","9","a little   feature to that process that specially suited my"
"1.3.2.8.20","10","particular   way of wanting to deal with miscellaneous thoughts"
"1.3.2.8.20","11","that I   get. By various means, I very quickly learned that this"
"1.3.2.8.20","12","would   be easy to do if I could but reverse the order ln whlch"
"1.3.2.8.20","13","I   execute the sub-process Steps A and B, when I enter a piece"
"1.3.2.8.20","14","of   lnformation. I had to find out if I could safely reverse"
"1.3.2.8.20","15","their   order without getting into trouble someplace in my"
"1.3.2.8.20","16","system."
"1.3.2.8.21","1","&quot;This I could do relatively rapidly,   by your standards,"
"1.3.2.8.21","2","by snooping down the antecedent trails,   looking for statements"
"1.3.2.8.21","3","relevant to this timing question. There   is, in fact, a semi-"
"1.3.2.8.21","4","automatic processes available to me for   speeding just such"
"1.3.2.8.21","5","searches. The computer keeps track of where   I have looked,"
"1.3.2.8.21","6","where I've marked things as yes, or no, or   possible, and does"
"1.3.2.8.21","7","the bookkeeping and calculating necessary   to guide me through"
"1.3.2.8.21","8","an optimum search strategy. But the   special tagging we do when"
"1.3.2.8.21","9","we make a process structure lets   this search be fully"
"1.3.2.8.21","10","automatic when certain kinds of   relationships are involved--"
"1.3.2.8.21","11","and relative timing happens to be   one of these relationships."
"1.3.2.8.22","1","&quot;So I phrased a question which   essentially asked for"
"1.3.2.8.22","2","considerations relevant to the order in   which these two steps"
"1.3.2.8.22","3","were executed, and turned the computer   loose. It took about"
"1.3.2.8.22","4","three seconds for the results to be   forthcoming--you haven't"
"1.3.2.8.22","5","yet seen me request a task that took   a noticeable period of"
"1.3.2.8.22","6","machine time, have you? But anyway, the   computer discovered a"
"1.3.2.8.22","7","relevance trail that ended up showing   that reversing the order"
"1.3.2.8.22","8","of Steps A and B during the   information-scrap entry process"
"1.3.2.8.22","9","would cripple a certain   feature in the planning-review"
"1.3.2.8.22","10","process, where miscellaneous   thoughts and possibilities are"
"1.3.2.8.22","11","gleaned from this store to be   considered relative to the"
"1.3.2.8.22","12","planning."
"1.3.2.8.23","1","&quot;But let's try to back away from   details for a bit, now,"
"1.3.2.8.23","2","and see if we can get a feeling for   the significance of the"
"1.3.2.8.23","3","things we've been talking   about. Comparison with other working"
"1.3.2.8.23","4","domains would be helpful,   perhaps.  If you were an inventor of"
"1.3.2.8.23","5","useful mechanisms, you   would like to have a wide range of"
"1.3.2.8.23","6","materials-processing and   shaping techniques available to you."
"1.3.2.8.23","7","This would give you more   freedom and more interesting"
"1.3.2.8.23","8","possibilities in the way you   worked and designed. But many of"
"1.3.2.8.23","9","these techniques are very   specialized; they require special"
"1.3.2.8.23","10","equipment, special skills to   execute the processing and"
"1.3.2.8.23","11","shaping, and special knowledge   about applicability and"
"1.3.2.8.23","12","possibillties for the techniques."
"1.3.2.8.24","1","&quot;Suppose you were told that you could   subscribe to a"
"1.3.2.8.24","2","community- owned installation of special   equipment--containing"
"1.3.2.8.24","3","all sorts of wonderful instruments tools   and machines for"
"1.3.2.8.24","4","measuring and processing with such as   chemical, optical,"
"1.3.2.8.24","5","mechanical, electronic, pneumatic, vacuum,   metallurgy, and"
"1.3.2.8.24","6","human factors. But this wasn't all that was   included in the"
"1.3.2.8.24","7","subscription.  There would be a specialist   assigned to you,"
"1.3.2.8.24","8","instantly available for consultation and help   whenever you"
"1.3.2.8.24","9","requested it. He wouldn't have high-level   theoretical"
"1.3.2.8.24","10","trainlng. His specialty would be familiarity with   the special"
"1.3.2.8.24","11","manuals compiled from what the theoreticians,   equipment"
"1.3.2.8.24","12","builders, and technicians know, and being able to   pinpoint"
"1.3.2.8.24","13","relevant data and apply complex rules and   specifications."
"1.3.2.8.25","1","&quot;A lot of questions you might ask he   couldn't answer"
"1.3.2.8.25","2","directly, but in such a case he could often   lead you quickly"
"1.3.2.8.25","3","to some relevant pages in his books. You   discovered that"
"1.3.2.8.25","4","usually a succession of well-chosen questions   of the sort he"
"1.3.2.8.25","5","<i>could</i> answer, interspersed with your   occasional study"
"1.3.2.8.25","6","of succinct and relevant material he'd dig up   for you, could"
"1.3.2.8.25","7","very rapidly develop answers to conceptually   sophisticated"
"1.3.2.8.25","8","questions. His help in your minute-by-minute   designing work"
"1.3.2.8.25","9","could be extremely valuable-- availing you of   quick and"
"1.3.2.8.25","10","realistic consideration of a great many new design"
"1.3.2.8.25","11","possibilities."
"1.3.2.8.26","1","&quot;Similarly, when it came to carrying   out a planned set of"
"1.3.2.8.26","2","operations, it turned out that he   couldn't carry out all of"
"1.3.2.8.26","3","the processes for you--he could   manage complex rules and"
"1.3.2.8.26","4","procedures beautifully, but he would   break down when it came"
"1.3.2.8.26","5","to steps that required what you might   call a larger view of"
"1.3.2.8.26","6","the situation. But this wasn't so   bad. The set of routine"
"1.3.2.8.26","7","processes which he could manage all   alone still provided you"
"1.3.2.8.26","8","with a great deal of help--in fact,   you got to developing ways"
"1.3.2.8.26","9","to build things so as to capitalize   upon his efficiency at"
"1.3.2.8.26","10","these tasks. Then the processes which   were too much for him"
"1.3.2.8.26","11","would be done by the two of you   together. He filled in all the"
"1.3.2.8.26","12","routine stuff and you took care   of the steps that were beyond"
"1.3.2.8.26","13","his capability Often the steps   you had to take care of were"
"1.3.2.8.26","14","buried in the middle of a complex   routine whose over-all"
"1.3.2.8.26","15","nature didn't have to be understood by   either of you for"
"1.3.2.8.26","16","proper execution. Your helper would keep   track of the complex"
"1.3.2.8.26","17","procedure and execute all the steps he   could. When he came to"
"1.3.2.8.26","18","a step that was too big for him, he   would hand you enough"
"1.3.2.8.26","19","information to allow you to take that   step, whereupon he would"
"1.3.2.8.26","20","take over again until he met another   such step."
"1.3.2.8.27","1","&quot;As an inventor and builder of   devices that solve needs,"
"1.3.2.8.27","2","you could become a great deal more   versatile and productive,"
"1.3.2.8.27","3","applying your imagination,   intuition, judgment, and"
"1.3.2.8.27","4","intelligence very effectively over a   much wider range of"
"1.3.2.8.27","5","possibilities. You could tackle much more   complex and"
"1.3.2.8.27","6","sophisticated projects, you could come up with   very much"
"1.3.2.8.27","7","better results--neater, cheaper, more reliable, more"
"1.3.2.8.27","8","versatile, higher-quality performance--and you could work"
"1.3.2.8.27","9","faster. Your effectiveness in this domain of activity would be"
"1.3.2.8.27","10","considerably increased."
"1.3.2.8.28","1","&quot;So let's turn back to the working   domain which we are"
"1.3.2.8.28","2","considering here. It is an intellectual   one, where the"
"1.3.2.8.28","3","processing and shaping done is of conceptual   material rather"
"1.3.2.8.28","4","than physical material. But between these two   types of working"
"1.3.2.8.28","5","domains we nonetheless find closely analogous   conditions"
"1.3.2.8.28","6","relative to the variety and sophistication of the   processes"
"1.3.2.8.28","7","and techniques applicable to what nonroutine workers   do."
"1.3.2.8.28","8","Consider the intellectual domain of a creative problem   solver,"
"1.3.2.8.28","9","and listen to me rattle off the names of some   specialized"
"1.3.2.8.28","10","disciplines that come to mind. These esoteric   disciplines"
"1.3.2.8.28","11","could very possibly contribute specialized   processes and"
"1.3.2.8.28","12","techniques to a general worker in the   intellectual domain:"
"1.3.2.8.28","13","Formal logic--mathematics of many   varieties, including"
"1.3.2.8.28","14","statistics-- decision theory--game   theory--time and motion"
"1.3.2.8.28","15","analysis--operations   research--classification theory--"
"1.3.2.8.28","16","documentation theory--cost   accounting, for time, energy, or"
"1.3.2.8.28","17","money--dynamic   programming--computer programming. These are"
"1.3.2.8.28","18","only a few of the   total, I'm sure."
"1.3.2.8.29","1","&quot;This implies the range of   potentially applicable"
"1.3.2.8.29","2","processes. Realize that there is also a   correspondingly large"
"1.3.2.8.29","3","list of specialized materials   potentially usable in the"
"1.3.2.8.29","4","fabrications of the intellectual   worker. I speak, of course,"
"1.3.2.8.29","5","about the conceptual material in   the many different flelds of"
"1.3.2.8.29","6","human interest. The things that I   have been de monstrating to"
"1.3.2.8.29","7","you this afternoon were designed   to increase significantlY the"
"1.3.2.8.29","8","range of both processes and   materials over which a human can"
"1.3.2.8.29","9","practically operate within   this intellectual domain. You might"
"1.3.2.8.29","10","say that we do this by   providing him with a very fast, agile"
"1.3.2.8.29","11","vehicle, equipped with   all sorts of high-performance sensory"
"1.3.2.8.29","12","equipment and   navigational aids, and carrying very flexible,"
"1.3.2.8.29","13","powerful,   semi-automatic devices for operating upon the"
"1.3.2.8.29","14","materials of   this domain. Not only that, but to provide an"
"1.3.2.8.29","15","accurate   analogy, we have to give him a computer to help him"
"1.3.2.8.29","16","organize   and monitor his activity and assess his results. We"
"1.3.2.8.29","17","get direct   help on many levels of activity in our system, you"
"1.3.2.8.29","18","see."
"1.3.2.8.30","1","&quot;But back to the topic of tools, and   the analogy of the"
"1.3.2.8.30","2","inventor who was given the equipment and   the helper. Our"
"1.3.2.8.30","3","augmented intellectual worker gets essentially   this same kind"
"1.3.2.8.30","4","of service, only more so--a compounding of this   kind of"
"1.3.2.8.30","5","service. Structuring our processes with care and   precision"
"1.3.2.8.30","6","enables the computer to answer limited questions, to   guide you"
"1.3.2.8.30","7","to relevant descriptions and specifications within   its"
"1.3.2.8.30","8","structure, to execute complex but limited-grasp processes   on"
"1.3.2.8.30","9","its own, and to take care of complex rule and   procedure-"
"1.3.2.8.30","10","following bookkeeping in guiding the execution of"
"1.3.2.8.30","11","sophisticated composite processes. This actually makes it"
"1.3.2.8.30","12","practical to use many specialized processes and techniques"
"1.3.2.8.30","13","from very esoteric fields--to assess their applicability and"
"1.3.2.8.30","14","limitations quickly, to incorporate them intelligently into"
"1.3.2.8.30","15","the design and analysis of possible courses of action, and to"
"1.3.2.8.30","16","execute them efficiently."
"1.3.2.8.31","1","&quot;Our specialized processes represent   a beautiful"
"1.3.2.8.31","2","collection of special tools. These tools are   designed by"
"1.3.2.8.31","3","specialists, and they come equipped with operating"
"1.3.2.8.31","4","instructions, trouble-shooting hints, and complete design"
"1.3.2.8.31","5","data. Furthermore, we are provided with other tools that help"
"1.3.2.8.31","6","us determine the applicability of these tools by automatically"
"1.3.2.8.31","7","operating upon the instruction manual for us. Further, if"
"1.3.2.8.31","8","something goes wrong with one of these tools, if we want to"
"1.3.2.8.31","9","design a new tool of our own and make use of one of its"
"1.3.2.8.31","10","modular components, or if we want to rearrange some of its"
"1.3.2.8.31","11","adjustable features, we get considerable help in learning what"
"1.3.2.8.31","12","we have to know about its design, and in making adjustments or"
"1.3.2.8.31","13","coupling a part of it to another tool. Our shop contains an"
"1.3.2.8.31","14","efficient tool-making section, where we can design and build"
"1.3.2.8.31","15","our own tools from scratch, or by incorporating parts or all"
"1.3.2.8.31","16","of any other tools we have."
"1.3.2.8.32","1","&quot;Let me tell you of an interesting   feature stemming from"
"1.3.2.8.32","2","my using such improved   Process-structuring techniques. An"
"1.3.2.8.32","3","effective job of breaking   down a complex problem into humanly"
"1.3.2.8.32","4","manageable steps--and this   is essentially what we seek in our"
"1.3.2.8.32","5","process structuring--will   provide the human with something to"
"1.3.2.8.32","6","do at every turn. This may   be to ponder or go searching, true"
"1.3.2.8.32","7","enough--we aren't saying   that the steps are necessarily"
"1.3.2.8.32","8","straightforward. But the point   I want to make is that no"
"1.3.2.8.32","9","longer am I ever at a loss as to   what to do next.  I get stuck"
"1.3.2.8.32","10","at times, to be sure, but when I   do I have clean and direct"
"1.3.2.8.32","11","ways to satisfy myself that I   should just beat away at that"
"1.3.2.8.32","12","roadblock for the time   being."
"1.3.2.8.33","1","&quot;And then, for beating away at the   roadblock, my"
"1.3.2.8.33","2","bookkeeping regarding what I've tried, what   possibilities I've"
"1.3.2.8.33","3","collected, and what my assumptions and   objectives are, is good"
"1.3.2.8.33","4","enough to help tremendously in keeping   me from getting into"
"1.3.2.8.33","5","loops and quandaries,in carefully ex   hausting possibilities,"
"1.3.2.8.33","6","and in really analyzing my assumptions   and objectives. What's"
"1.3.2.8.33","7","more, I'm not generating reams of   cyclic arguments, lists,"
"1.3.2.8.33","8","calculations, or the like--either I'm   checking the validity of"
"1.3.2.8.33","9","what I've already structured, or I am   correcting or expanding"
"1.3.2.8.33","10","the structure. In other words, it   seems that the growth of my"
"1.3.2.8.33","11","comprehension is sure and steady   up to the point at which I"
"1.3.2.8.33","12","succeed or give up. If I give up, I   leave a structure which is"
"1.3.2.8.33","13","very well organized to accommodate   a subsequent revisit with"
"1.3.2.8.33","14","new data, possibilities,   assumptions, objectives, or tools."
"1.3.2.8.33","15","Also, I set up a sentinel   process that will operate in the"
"1.3.2.8.33","16","future to help alert me to   concepts which may clear the block."
"1.3.2.8.34","1","&quot;This feature, of always having   satisfying actions to"
"1.3.2.8.34","2","perform, and having a good feeling that   they are what I should"
"1.3.2.8.34","3","be doing at that time, gives a   surprisingly contented, eager,"
"1.3.2.8.34","4","and absorbing flavor to my   work. I guess it's an adult"
"1.3.2.8.34","5","instance of the sort of change   observed in students when they"
"1.3.2.8.34","6","were given teaching machines   that provided continuous"
"1.3.2.8.34","7","participation and reinforcement."
"1.3.2.8.35","1","&quot;Anyway, with the quick flexibility   available to me for"
"1.3.2.8.35","2","structuring arguments, and semi-automatic   application of"
"1.3.2.8.35","3","special tagging and linking rules, I find it   really quite easy"
"1.3.2.8.35","4","to construct, use, or modify sophisticated   process"
"1.3.2.8.35","5","structuring. And I can turn right around and apply   this toward"
"1.3.2.8.35","6","improving my abllity for structuring argumentg and   processes."
"1.3.2.8.35","7","The initial, straightforward capabilities for   manipulating"
"1.3.2.8.35","8","symbol structures, that were more or less   obviously availed me"
"1.3.2.8.35","9","by the computer have given to me a power   to participate in"
"1.3.2.8.35","10","more sophisticated processes that capitalize   more fully upon"
"1.3.2.8.35","11","the computer's capability--processes which are   very"
"1.3.2.8.35","12","significant to my net effectiveness, and yet which   weren't"
"1.3.2.8.35","13","particularly apparent to us as either possible or   useful in"
"1.3.2.8.35","14","the days before we started harnessing computers to   the human's"
"1.3.2.8.35","15","workaday activities in this direct way.'"
"1.3.2.9","1","7. Team Cooperation"
"1.3.2.9.1","1","&quot;Let me mention another bonus feature   that wasn't easily"
"1.3.2.9.1","2","fore seen.  We have experimented with   having several people"
"1.3.2.9.1","3","work together from working stations that   can provide inter-"
"1.3.2.9.1","4","communication via their computer or   computers.  That is, each"
"1.3.2.9.1","5","person is equipped as I am here,   with free access to the"
"1.3.2.9.1","6","common working structures. There   proves to be a really"
"1.3.2.9.1","7","phenomenal boost in group effectiveness   over any previous form"
"1.3.2.9.1","8","of cooperation we have experienced.   They can all work on the"
"1.3.2.9.1","9","same symbol structure, wherever they   might wish.  If any two"
"1.3.2.9.1","10","want to work simultaneously on the   same material, they simply"
"1.3.2.9.1","11","duplicate and each starts reshaping   his version--and later it"
"1.3.2.9.1","12","is easy to merge their   contributions. The whole team can join"
"1.3.2.9.1","13","forces at a moment's   notice to 'pull together' on some"
"1.3.2.9.1","14","stubborn little problem, or   to make a group decision. Most"
"1.3.2.9.1","15","points of contention are   resolved quite naturally, over a"
"1.3.2.9.1","16","period of time, as the   developing structure of argument bears"
"1.3.2.9.1","17","out one, or the other,   or neither stand."
"1.3.2.9.2","1","&quot;No one can dominate the show, since   seldom do you have"
"1.3.2.9.2","2","to 'listen' to the person concurrent to the   developments he is"
"1.3.2.9.2","3","pursuing-- and yet at any time another   person can tune in on"
"1.3.2.9.2","4","what he has done and is doing. One can   either take immediate"
"1.3.2.9.2","5","personal issue with another about some   feature, anywhere in"
"1.3.2.9.2","6","the structure where he might find   something done by the other"
"1.3.2.9.2","7","to which he wants to take issue,   or he can append his"
"1.3.2.9.2","8","objection and the associated argument   there where the"
"1.3.2.9.2","9","disagreement lies, and tag this with a special   cue that"
"1.3.2.9.2","10","signals a point of contention that must ultimately be"
"1.3.2.9.2","11","resolved. Any idea of the moment by any member can easily be"
"1.3.2.9.2","12","linked to where it can do some good. It gets to be like a real"
"1.3.2.9.2","13","whing-ding free-for-all--tremendously stimulating and"
"1.3.2.9.2","14","satisfying, and things really get done. You find yourself"
"1.3.2.9.2","15","'playing over your head' almost all of the time."
"1.3.2.9.3","1","&quot;We have been experimenting with   multi-disciplinary teams"
"1.3.2.9.3","2","and are becoming especially excited   over the results. For"
"1.3.2.9.3","3","instance, there is a great reduction of   the barrier that their"
"1.3.2.9.3","4","different terminologies used to   represent, where one"
"1.3.2.9.3","5","specialist couldn't really apply his   experien ce, intuition,"
"1.3.2.9.3","6","or conceptual feel very well unless   the situation could be"
"1.3.2.9.3","7","stated and framed in his accustomed   manner, and yet the others"
"1.3.2.9.3","8","couldn't work with his   terminology. Here, they meet at their"
"1.3.2.9.3","9","concept and terminology   interface and work out little shifts"
"1.3.2.9.3","10","in meaning and use which   each can find digestible in his"
"1.3.2.9.3","11","system, and which permit quite   precise definitions in each"
"1.3.2.9.3","12","system of the terms and concepts   in the others. In studying"
"1.3.2.9.3","13","the other's structuring then,   either of them can have his own"
"1.3.2.9.3","14","definitions automatically   substituted for the other's special"
"1.3.2.9.3","15","terms. Reduce this   language barrier, and provide the feature"
"1.3.2.9.3","16","of their being able   to work in parallel independence on the"
"1.3.2.9.3","17","joint structure, and   what seems to result is amplification of"
"1.3.2.9.3","18","their different   capabilities."
"1.3.2.9.4","1","&quot;Remember the term, synergesis, that   has been associated"
"1.3.2.9.4","2","in the literature with general structuring   theory? Well, here"
"1.3.2.9.4","3","is something of an example. Three people   working together in"
"1.3.2.9.4","4","this augmented mode seem to be more than   three times as"
"1.3.2.9.4","5","effective in solving a complex problem as is   one augmented"
"1.3.2.9.4","6","person working alone--and perhaps ten times as   effective as"
"1.3.2.9.4","7","three similar men working together without this   computer-based"
"1.3.2.9.4","8","augmentation.  It is a new and exhiliarating   experience to be"
"1.3.2.9.4","9","working in this independent-parallel fashion   with some good"
"1.3.2.9.4","10","men. We feel that the effect of these   augmentation"
"1.3.2.9.4","11","developments upon group methods and group   capability is"
"1.3.2.9.4","12","actually going to be more pronounced than the   effect upon"
"1.3.2.9.4","13","individuals methods and capabilities, and we are   very eager to"
"1.3.2.9.4","14","increase our research effort in that   direction.&quot;"
"1.3.2.10","1","8. Miscellaneous Advanced   Concepts"
"1.3.2.10.1","1","&quot;I have dragged you through a lot of   different concepts"
"1.3.2.10.1","2","and methods so far. I haven't been complete   because we won't"
"1.3.2.10.1","3","have the time. But I have selected the sample   features to"
"1.3.2.10.1","4","present to you with an eye toward giving you a   maximum chance"
"1.3.2.10.1","5","to identify these as being something   significant to your own"
"1.3.2.10.1","6","type of work. I avoided discussing   techniques applicable to"
"1.3.2.10.1","7","esoteric problem-solving   processes--although some of them"
"1.3.2.10.1","8","display especially   stimulating possibilities to those with"
"1.3.2.10.1","9","appropriate   backgrounds. The ability to structure arguments"
"1.3.2.10.1","10","organized in   English-language statements, and to make use of"
"1.3.2.10.1","11","the linking   and tagging capabilities at all levels of the"
"1.3.2.10.1","12","structure, can   be seen to lead to many interesting and"
"1.3.2.10.1","13","promising new   capabilities for organizing your thoughts and"
"1.3.2.10.1","14","actions. I think   you could picture learning these tricks and"
"1.3.2.10.1","15","using them in your   own work."
"1.3.2.10.2","1","&quot;What I hoped to avoid by presenting   the system in this"
"1.3.2.10.2","2","way, was losing your identification with   these possibilities"
"1.3.2.10.2","3","by letting you get the mistaken impression   that an individual"
"1.3.2.10.2","4","couldn't harness these techniques usefully   unless he first"
"1.3.2.10.2","5","learned a lot of very sophisticated new   language, logic and"
"1.3.2.10.2","6","math. It is true that the more of the   sophisticated tricks you"
"1.3.2.10.2","7","learn, the more computer power you   can harness and the more"
"1.3.2.10.2","8","powerful you become--but very   significant and personally"
"1.3.2.10.2","9","thrilling practical problem-solving   capabilities have been"
"1.3.2.10.2","10","developed by quite a few subjects who   were given only fifteen"
"1.3.2.10.2","11","hours of training at one of these   stations. The training,"
"1.3.2.10.2","12","incidentally, was all provided by the   computer without the"
"1.3.2.10.2","13","presence of a human instructor. And the   people were of such"
"1.3.2.10.2","14","diverse fields as sociology, biology,   engineering management,"
"1.3.2.10.2","15","applied mathematics, and law. These   were all relatively high-"
"1.3.2.10.2","16","level people, and they were   completely and unreservedly"
"1.3.2.10.2","17","unanimous in their faith that   their increased capability would"
"1.3.2.10.2","18","easily justify the capital   and operating outlay that we"
"1.3.2.10.2","19","predicted for work stations of   this sort in five years, if the"
"1.3.2.10.2","20","computer industry really were   to take this type of potential"
"1.3.2.10.2","21","market seriously."
"1.3.2.10.3","1","&quot;What these people became capable of   was somewhat less"
"1.3.2.10.3","2","than the range of capabilities that we have   discussed so far--"
"1.3.2.10.3","3","but they would find it very natural to   develop further"
"1.3.2.10.3","4","techniques on their own, and new teaching   programs could be"
"1.3.2.10.3","5","provided them so that they could continue   learning the"
"1.3.2.10.3","6","improved techniques turned out by a research   group such as"
"1.3.2.10.3","7","ours here."
"1.3.2.10.4","1","&quot;But let me give you a brief view of   some of the more"
"1.3.2.10.4","2","advanced concepts and techniques that have   evolved here,"
"1.3.2.10.4","3","compatible with, but beyond, what I have so far   shown you. And"
"1.3.2.10.4","4","<i>evolved</i> is a good word to use here,   because our"
"1.3.2.10.4","5","appreciation for the potential worth of   possibilities to be"
"1.3.2.10.4","6","developed had to evolve too, and only came   with the experience"
"1.3.2.10.4","7","and perspective gained in our earlier   work."
"1.3.2.10.5","1","&quot;For instance, we initially felt   that defining categories"
"1.3.2.10.5","2","and relationships, and making a plan   for action, were things"
"1.3.2.10.5","3","to be done as quickly as possible so   that we could get on with"
"1.3.2.10.5","4","the work. But, as our means   developed for dealing with"
"1.3.2.10.5","5","definitions and plans more   precisely, easily, and flexibly, we"
"1.3.2.10.5","6","began to realize that they   in reality might be the most"
"1.3.2.10.5","7","significant part of that   work. With our immenseiy increased"
"1.3.2.10.5","8","capability for complex   bookkeeping relative to our interlaced"
"1.3.2.10.5","9","hierarchies of   objectives, plans, and arguments, we found that"
"1.3.2.10.5","10","defining a new   cate gory, searching for members or instances"
"1.3.2.10.5","11","of it, or   applying its selection criteria were becoming ever"
"1.3.2.10.5","12","conscious   and specific tasks."
"1.3.2.10.6","1","&quot;For instance, we began to find it   more and more useful"
"1.3.2.10.6","2","to distinguish different categories or   types of process,"
"1.3.2.10.6","3","different types of arguments, different   types of"
"1.3.2.10.6","4","relationships, and different types of descriptions.   For a"
"1.3.2.10.6","5","specific example, Ranganathan<a"
"1.3.2.10.6","6","href=&quot;#Notes-3-1&quot;>1</a> once cited five specific"
"1.3.2.10.6","7","relationships that could obtain between two terms, where one"
"1.3.2.10.6","8","modifies the other. He called these <i>phase</i> relations,"
"1.3.2.10.6","9","and named how one term could relate to the other as either"
"1.3.2.10.6","10","biasing it, being a tool used to study it, being an aspect of"
"1.3.2.10.6","11","it, being in comparison with it, or influencing it. Vickery"
"1.3.2.10.6","12","gave more examples, saying one could also have an effect on"
"1.3.2.10.6","13","the other, be a cause of it, be a use for it, be a substitute"
"1.3.2.10.6","14","for it, a source for it, an implication of it, be an"
"1.3.2.10.6","15","explanation of it, or be a representation of it. There are"
"1.3.2.10.6","16","even more categories mentioned in the literature."
"1.3.2.10.7","1","&quot;It was easy to form tags and links,   and we experimented"
"1.3.2.10.7","2","with the gains to be made by consciously   specifying and"
"1.3.2.10.7","3","indicating categories. It turned out to be a   very invigorating"
"1.3.2.10.7","4","innovation, and we began to take more pains   with our"
"1.3.2.10.7","5","structuring. It took longer to set up links and   nodes in our"
"1.3.2.10.7","6","structures, to be sure, but we found on the one   hand that the"
"1.3.2.10.7","7","structures became much cleaner and required   fewer members, and"
"1.3.2.10.7","8","on the other hand that we could get   considerably more"
"1.3.2.10.7","9","sophisticated help from the computer in   doing significant"
"1.3.2.10.7","10","chores for us."
"1.3.2.10.8","1","&quot;We began to work up processes that   would help us"
"1.3.2.10.8","2","establish categories, give them good   definitions, check their"
"1.3.2.10.8","3","relationship with other established   categories, decide whether"
"1.3.2.10.8","4","something fit a given category or   not, search for all possible"
"1.3.2.10.8","5","members of it within a given   substructure, and so forth.  The"
"1.3.2.10.8","6","very fact of using this   careful classifi cation within our"
"1.3.2.10.8","7","structures allowed us to   get more powerful help from the"
"1.3.2.10.8","8","computer in these   classification processes. I should mention"
"1.3.2.10.8","9","that the   relationships among the terms in a sentence--the"
"1.3.2.10.8","10","syntax if you   wish--had been given further specification tags"
"1.3.2.10.8","11","than those I   showed you earlier, to remove ambiguities that"
"1.3.2.10.8","12","hindered the   computer from going back to a statement and"
"1.3.2.10.8","13","resolving the   syntactical structure. Also, ambiguities in the"
"1.3.2.10.8","14","meaning of the   terms began to limit us, and we developed"
"1.3.2.10.8","15","methods for removing   a good deal of this semantic ambiguity."
"1.3.2.10.8","16","This slowed us down,   as I've mentioned, but not as much as"
"1.3.2.10.8","17","you'd think."
"1.3.2.10.9","1","&quot;Let me demonstrate one of the   advanced processes which"
"1.3.2.10.9","2","has evolved.  It is heavily dependent   upon the very care in"
"1.3.2.10.9","3","building structures that it so nicely   facilitates, and also"
"1.3.2.10.9","4","upon several other developments. One of   these other"
"1.3.2.10.9","5","developments stems from the concepts and   techniques of the"
"1.3.2.10.9","6","semantic differential, as first introduced   by Osgood, Suci,"
"1.3.2.10.9","7","and Tannenbaum <a href=&quot;#Notes-3-2&quot;>2</a> back in"
"1.3.2.10.9","8","1957, and from some subsequent work by Mayer and Bagley <a"
"1.3.2.10.9","9","href=&quot;#Notes-3-3&quot;>3</a> on what they called semantic"
"1.3.2.10.9","10","models. These offered useful possibilities for establishing"
"1.3.2.10.9","11","quite precisely what meaning a concept has to an individual,"
"1.3.2.10.9","12","relative to his general conceptual framework, and for"
"1.3.2.10.9","13","representing this meaning in a specific way that was amenable"
"1.3.2.10.9","14","to computer manipulation."
"1.3.2.10.10","1","&quot;The other development upon which   this process to be"
"1.3.2.10.10","2","exhibited is based, was stimulated by our   realizing that"
"1.3.2.10.10","3","flexible cooperation with the computer was   calling for lots of"
"1.3.2.10.10","4","little interactions. Our working   repertoire of small-task"
"1.3.2.10.10","5","requests for computer service was   getting quite large, and it"
"1.3.2.10.10","6","was proving to be extremely   valuable to use them and to be"
"1.3.2.10.10","7","able to remember automatically   their procedures and"
"1.3.2.10.10","8","designation codes. One of our research   psychologists had"
"1.3.2.10.10","9","worked on human-memory phenomena before he   came with us, and"
"1.3.2.10.10","10","had interested himself in mnemonic aids of   all sorts. He has"
"1.3.2.10.10","11","developed some useful techniques for us to   use in connection"
"1.3.2.10.10","12","with this, and other problems. Now let me   demonstrate this"
"1.3.2.10.10","13","example of an advanced process for helping   work with"
"1.3.2.10.10","14","categories."
"1.3.2.10.11","1","&quot;Suppose that I want to establish a   new category. Let's"
"1.3.2.10.11","2","say that I have developed its description   in what you and I"
"1.3.2.10.11","3","have been calling an argument structure. I   want to give it a"
"1.3.2.10.11","4","name--a short and meaningful one--and I want   a good"
"1.3.2.10.11","5","definition. In fact, I want a definition that the   computer can"
"1.3.2.10.11","6","later work with. Look, I'll dig up a description   that is"
"1.3.2.10.11","7","awaiting such a definition, and you can watch what"
"1.3.2.10.11","8","happens.&quot; So saying, Joe drummed on his keysets for a"
"1.3.2.10.11","9","moment,   with one interruption when the computer flashed"
"1.3.2.10.11","10","something on   the screen that was apparently a question about"
"1.3.2.10.11","11","what he was   asking the computer to find for him. He finally"
"1.3.2.10.11","12","had a network   display on one screen and a set of"
"1.3.2.10.11","13","&quot;exploded&quot; statements on   the upper half of the"
"1.3.2.10.11","14","other."
"1.3.2.10.12","1","&quot;I'm initiating the naming and   defining process now, and"
"1.3.2.10.12","2","de signating to it the argument   structure represented by this"
"1.3.2.10.12","3","network as what I want named and   defined. Watch what"
"1.3.2.10.12","4","happens.&quot; A few more strokes on the   keyset, and he picked"
"1.3.2.10.12","5","up his light pen in anticipation and   waited a few moments. A"
"1.3.2.10.12","6","statement appeared in the lower half   of the second frame. He"
"1.3.2.10.12","7","studied it a moment, then looked at   the statements above,"
"1.3.2.10.12","8","picked out a node on the network with   the pen, and hit the"
"1.3.2.10.12","9","keyset a few strokes. Another statement   flashed on almost"
"1.3.2.10.12","10","immediately, with two familiar adjectives   placed below and a"
"1.3.2.10.12","11","graduated line between them. Joe studied   this, referred to the"
"1.3.2.10.12","12","statements above, flipped through   several levels of network"
"1.3.2.10.12","13","portrayals, through a few statements   representing a couple of"
"1.3.2.10.12","14","low-level nodes, reflected a moment,   and then pointed his"
"1.3.2.10.12","15","light pen at a point on the graduated   line, part way between"
"1.3.2.10.12","16","the adjectives, and pressed its   button."
"1.3.2.10.13","1","&quot;Actually, right now I'm   demonstrating a cooperative"
"1.3.2.10.13","2","process execution technique. This   process is applying some"
"1.3.2.10.13","3","very sophisticated criteria and using   some very sophisticated"
"1.3.2.10.13","4","analytical techniques, and it is set   up so that it is actually"
"1.3.2.10.13","5","the computer that is now in the   executive seat. I called for"
"1.3.2.10.13","6","the process, but its execution   essentially involves the"
"1.3.2.10.13","7","computer's asking me questions, and   feeding me successive"
"1.3.2.10.13","8","questions according to how I've answered   the previous ones. It"
"1.3.2.10.13","9","also is doing a lot of work on the   symbol structure that"
"1.3.2.10.13","10","represents my description. It, with some   small help from me,"
"1.3.2.10.13","11","is proceeding through a quite complex   analysis of the meaning"
"1.3.2.10.13","12","that this incipient concept has to me,   and of certain types of"
"1.3.2.10.13","13","mental associations that I may have   with it. I don't have to"
"1.3.2.10.13","14","remember the special rules and forms   of analysis involved--"
"1.3.2.10.13","15","nevertheless, a very sophisticated   little capability is mine"
"1.3.2.10.13","16","to use at will, taxing neither me   nor the computer.&quot;"
"1.3.2.10.14","1","After a little over a minute of   these question-answer"
"1.3.2.10.14","2","interactions, the process apparently   terminated, with four"
"1.3.2.10.14","3","lines of special terms remaining on the   screen. &quot;This"
"1.3.2.10.14","4","first line gives me two suggested names for this   category or"
"1.3.2.10.14","5","concept. The first term is a newly coined formal   name, while"
"1.3.2.10.14","6","the remaining three terms represent a compound   expression,"
"1.3.2.10.14","7","involving established concepts, that can be used   also as a"
"1.3.2.10.14","8","designation of the new category. The second line   furnishes me"
"1.3.2.10.14","9","with an association chain to use for a mnemonic   aid in"
"1.3.2.10.14","10","remembering the new name-- linking the name to several"
"1.3.2.10.14","11","characteristics of the concept. The name itself was selected"
"1.3.2.10.14","12","under mnemonic criteria, as well as to have a structure that"
"1.3.2.10.14","13","goes with its syntactic and semantic categories.  The third"
"1.3.2.10.14","14","line lists the names of some previously defined categories or"
"1.3.2.10.14","15","concepts that are the closest to this in meanlng--these before"
"1.3.2.10.14","16","the break were found to overlap, and the rest are just   close."
"1.3.2.10.15","1","&quot;The fourth line you recognize as a   statement form,"
"1.3.2.10.15","2","perhaps. This is the definition, as developed   by the computer."
"1.3.2.10.15","3","It's in a special language and I won't try to   explain. I'll"
"1.3.2.10.15","4","just mention that I can now study it, take it   apart, check its"
"1.3.2.10.15","5","references, so to speak, and perhaps even see   if the computer"
"1.3.2.10.15","6","and I might work out any changes or   improvementS But this"
"1.3.2.10.15","7","process has been worked on pretty hard,   and we're getting"
"1.3.2.10.15","8","definitions that are hard to improve."
"1.3.2.10.16","1","&quot;This special language, in which I   said the definition"
"1.3.2.10.16","2","was stated, is a recent development. We   had found that the"
"1.3.2.10.16","3","types of structuring we were developing had   a lot of extra"
"1.3.2.10.16","4","tags and links that were traceable to the   complexity of the"
"1.3.2.10.16","5","rules and combinatorial possibilities of the   English language"
"1.3.2.10.16","6","with which the statements were construct We   finally got a"
"1.3.2.10.16","7","clear enough picture of the requirements we   place upon a"
"1.3.2.10.16","8","language in our use here that we could consider   designing our"
"1.3.2.10.16","9","own special language. It turned out to be a   straightforward"
"1.3.2.10.16","10","and rather simple language compared with   English, but much"
"1.3.2.10.16","11","more precise and powerful. It proves rather   inflexible and"
"1.3.2.10.16","12","awkward to use for speaking, but it provides   plenty of"
"1.3.2.10.16","13","flexibility and power for expressing things in the   visual-"

"1.3.2.10.16","15","ambiguity in a well-formed statement, and makes it   much easier"
"1.3.2.10.16","16","to reduCe semantic ambiguity to the point where   the computer"

"1.3.2.10.16","18","or formal-logic expressionc"
"1.3.2.10.17","1","&quot;It is worth mentioning, too, that   we are experimenting"
"1.3.2.10.17","2","with standard ways of structuring   arguments at levels higher"
"1.3.2.10.17","3","than the state ments--sort of a   super grammar or syntax, with"

"1.3.2.10.18","3","opposed to absolute true false statements which   the more"
"1.3.2.10.18","4","familiar formal logic can manipulate. This finds   approval and"

"1.3.2.10.19","4","important aspects of the meaning that   is contained in our"

"1.3.2.10.19","6","there existed only conceptually implicit   data. With practice"
"1.3.2.10.19","7","and good strategy, asking questions like   this proves to be a"
"1.3.2.10.19","8","tremendously effective way to gain   comprehension about a"
"1.3.2.10.19","9","structure. We even have special   processes and symbol-"
"1.3.2.10.19","10","structuring methods to help organize the   questioning and the"
"1.3.2.10.19","11","answers. Some of the answers are a bit   costly, however--in"
"1.3.2.10.19","12","computer time and charges--and we have to   watch the way we ask"
"1.3.2.10.19","13","questions. Some of our researchers are   studying the language"
"1.3.2.10.19","14","and structuring techniques relative to   this problem, and they"
"1.3.2.10.19","15","think they see ways to change them to   make question answering"
"1.3.2.10.19","16","generally more efficient. But this   sort of thing will likely"
"1.3.2.10.19","17","always have its cost problems, as   far as we can see now.&quot;"
"1.3.2.10.20","1","He went on to say that the computer   now represents such an"
"1.3.2.10.20","2","intelligent helper--although much less   so than any human"
"1.3.2.10.20","3","helper they would hire--that they refer to   it as <i>the"
"1.3.2.10.20","4","Clerk</i>. They can make a tentative new   statement in the"
"1.3.2.10.20","5","development of a structure, and have the   clerk look over the"

"1.3.2.10.20","7","also point out some of the   weaknesses in the statement, as"
"1.3.2.10.20","8","well as some of the effects of   the statement upon the rest of"
"1.3.2.10.20","9","the structure. They find that   they need to give less and less"
"1.3.2.10.20","10","human concern for the details   of structure building--in-fact,"
"1.3.2.10.20","11","the roles have reversed a   little. Where the human used to set"

"1.3.2.10.21","4","job of picking out the steps   which contributed the most to the"

"1.3.2.10.21","6","This process, and some of the   past data collected by its use,"
"1.3.2.10.21","7","were becoming an important   addition to the planning review"
"1.3.2.10.21","8","sessions, as well as to the   continuing development of improved"
"1.3.2.10.21","9","methods. And apparently, it   had a surprisingly positive"
"1.3.2.10.21","10","psychological effect upon members   of a cooperating team, where"
"1.3.2.10.21","11","an objective means of relative   scoring was thus available."
"1.3.3","1","Let yourself be disengaged now from your role in the above"
"1.3.3","2","discussion-demonstration.  You have been through an experience"
"1.3.3","3","that was designed to give you a feel for the sort of future"
"1.3.3","4","developments that (to us) are predictable from <i>our</i>"
"1.3.3","5","conceptual framework. What is presented in Section II is an"
"1.3.3","6","attempt at giving a &quot;straight&quot; presentation of the"
"1.3.3","7","various conceptual segments of this framework, and Section III"
"1.3.3","8","hopefully supplemented the formal presentation to provide you"
"1.3.3","9","with a more complete picture of how we are oriented and what"
"1.3.3","10","sorts of possibilities impel us."
"1.3.4","1","Assuming that we have communicated our conceptual framework in"
"1.3.4","2","some reasonable form, we proceed below to discuss the question"
"1.3.4","3","of what to do about it. Our approach to this question is with"
"1.3.4","4","the view that energetic pursuit of this research could be of"
"1.3.4","5","considerable significance to society, and that research should"
"1.3.4","6","stem from a big enough picture of the over-all possibilities so"
"1.3.4","7","that the contribution of any program, large or small, could have"
"1.3.4","8","maximum long-range significance. Our recommendations are fairly"
"1.3.4","9","general, and are cast in rather global terms, but we assert that"
"1.3.4","10","they can be readily recast into the specific terms required of"
"1.3.4","11","research planning to be done for a given project, within a given"
"1.3.4","12","set of subgoals and research-activity constraints. In fact, we"
"1.3.4","13","are now engaged in the process of so recasting these general"
"1.3.4","14","recommendations into specific plans (for the experimental"
"1.3.4","15","research to be pursued here at Stanford Research Institute)."
"1.4","1","IV. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS"
"1.4.1","1","A. OBJECTIVES FOR A RESEARCH PROGRAM"
"1.4.1.1","1","The report has put forth the hypothesis that the intellectual"
"1.4.1.1","2","effectiveness of a human being is dependent upon factors which"
"1.4.1.1","3","are subject to direct redesign in pursuit of an increase in that"
"1.4.1.1","4","effectiveness. A conceptual framework is offered to help in"
"1.4.1.1","5","giving consideration to this hypothesis, and an extensive and"
"1.4.1.1","6","personalized projection into possible future developments is"
"1.4.1.1","7","presented to help develop a feeling for the possi bilities and"
"1.4.1.1","8","promise implicit in the hypothesis and conceptual structure."
"1.4.1.2","1","If this hypothesis and its glowing extrapolations were borne out"
"1.4.1.2","2","in future developments, the consequences would be most exciting"
"1.4.1.2","3","and assumedly beneficial to a problem-laden world. What is"
"1.4.1.2","4","called for now is a test of this hypothesis and a calibration on"
"1.4.1.2","5","the gains if any that might be realized by giving total-system"
"1.4.1.2","6","design attention to human intellectual effectiveness.  If the"
"1.4.1.2","7","test and calibration proved to be favorable, then we can set to"
"1.4.1.2","8","work developing better and better augmentation systems for our"
"1.4.1.2","9","problem solvers."
"1.4.1.3","1","In this light, we recommend a research program approach aimed at"
"1.4.1.3","2","(Goal 1) testing the hypothesis, (Goal 2) developing the tools"
"1.4.1.3","3","and tech niques for designing better augmentation systems, and"
"1.4.1.3","4","(Goal 3) producing real-world augmentation systems that bring"
"1.4.1.3","5","maximum gains over the coming years to the solvers of tough,"
"1.4.1.3","6","critical problems. These goals and the resulting design for"
"1.4.1.3","7","their pursuit are idealized, to be sure, but the results"
"1.4.1.3","8","nonetheless have valuable aspects."
"1.4.2","1","B. BASIC RESEARCH CONDITIONS"
"1.4.2.1","1","This should be an empirical approach on a total-system basis--"
"1.4.2.1","2","i.e., doing coordinated study and innovation, among all the"
"1.4.2.1","3","factors admitted to the problem, in conjunction with experiments"
"1.4.2.1","4","that provide realistic action and interplay among these"
"1.4.2.1","5","variables. The question of limiting these factors is considered"
"1.4.2.1","6","later in the section. The recommended en vironment for this"
"1.4.2.1","7","empirical, total-system approach, is a laboratory providing a"
"1.4.2.1","8","computer-backed display and communication system of the general"
"1.4.2.1","9","sort described in Section III-B. There should be no stinting on"
"1.4.2.1","10","the capabilities provided--it is very important to learn what"
"1.4.2.1","11","value any given artifact feature may offer the total system, and"
"1.4.2.1","12","the only way to learn the value is to experiment with the"
"1.4.2.1","13","feature. At this point no time will be taken to develop"
"1.4.2.1","14","elaborate improvements in the art of time sharing, to provide"
"1.4.2.1","15","real-time service to many users. This kind of development should"
"1.4.2.1","16","be done as separate, backup work. The experimental lab should"
"1.4.2.1","17","take the steps that are immediately available to provide all the"
"1.4.2.1","18","service to the human that he needs in the experimental"
"1.4.2.1","19","environment."
"1.4.2.2","1","Where economy demands that a computer not be idle during the"
"1.4.2.2","2","time the augmented subject is not using it (which would be a"
"1.4.2.2","3","rather large net fraction of the time, probably), and where"
"1.4.2.2","4","sharing the computer with other real-time users for which demand"
"1.4.2.2","5","delays are a problem, then the only sharing that should be"
"1.4.2.2","6","considered is that with off-line computations for which there"
"1.4.2.2","7","are no real-time service demands to be met. The computer can"
"1.4.2.2","8","turn away from off-line users whenever the on-line worker needs"
"1.4.2.2","9","attention of any sort."
"1.4.3","1","C. WHOM TO AUGMENT FIRST"
"1.4.3.1","1","The experimental work of deriving, testing, and integrating"
"1.4.3.1","2","innovations into a growing system of augmentation means must"
"1.4.3.1","3","have a specific type of human task to try to develop more"
"1.4.3.1","4","effectiveness for, to give unifying focus to the research. We"
"1.4.3.1","5","recommend the particular task of computer programming for this"
"1.4.3.1","6","purpose--with many reasons behind the selection that should come"
"1.4.3.1","7","out in the following discussion. Some of the more direct reasons"
"1.4.3.1","8","are these:"
"1.4.3.1.1","1","1. The programmer works on many problems, including large and"
"1.4.3.1.1","2","realistic ones, which can be solved without interaction with"
"1.4.3.1.1","3","other humans. This eases the experimental problem."
"1.4.3.1.2","1","2. Typical and realistic problems for the programmer to solve"
"1.4.3.1.2","2","can be posed for experimental purposes that do not involve large"
"1.4.3.1.2","3","amounts of working and reference in formation. This also eases"
"1.4.3.1.2","4","the experimental problem."
"1.4.3.1.3","1","3. Much of the programmer's working data are computer programs"
"1.4.3.1.3","2","(he also has, we assume, his own reasoning and planning notes),"
"1.4.3.1.3","3","which have unambiguous syntactic and semantic form so that"
"1.4.3.1.3","4","getting the computer to do useful tasks for him on his working"
"1.4.3.1.3","5","data will be much facilitated--which helps very much to get"
"1.4.3.1.3","6","early experience on the value a human can derlve from this kind"
"1.4.3.1.3","7","of computer help."
"1.4.3.1.4","1","4. A programmer's effectiveness, relative to other programmers,"
"1.4.3.1.4","2","can probably be measured more easily than would be the case for"
"1.4.3.1.4","3","most other complex-problem solvers. For example, few other"
"1.4.3.1.4","4","complex solutions or designs beside a program can so easily be"
"1.4.3.1.4","5","given the rigorous test of &quot;Does it actually work?&quot;"
"1.4.3.1.5","1","5. The programmer's normal work involves interactions with a"
"1.4.3.1.5","2","computer (although heretofore not generally on-line), and this"
"1.4.3.1.5","3","will help researchers use the computer as a tool for learning"
"1.4.3.1.5","4","about the programmer's habits and needs."
"1.4.3.1.6","1","6. There are some very challenging types of intellectual effort"
"1.4.3.1.6","2","involved in programming. Attempting to increase human"
"1.4.3.1.6","3","effectiveness therein will provide an excellent means for"
"1.4.3.1.6","4","testing our hypothesis."
"1.4.3.1.7","1","7. Successful achievements in evolving new augmentation means"
"1.4.3.1.7","2","which significantly improve a programmer's capability will not"
"1.4.3.1.7","3","only serve to prove the hypothesis, but will lead directly to"
"1.4.3.1.7","4","possible practical application of augmentation systems to a"
"1.4.3.1.7","5","real-world problem domain that can use help."
"1.4.3.1.8","1","8. Computer programmers are a natural group to be the first in"
"1.4.3.1.8","2","the &quot;real world&quot; to incorporate the type of"
"1.4.3.1.8","3","augmentation means we are considering.  They already know how to"
"1.4.3.1.8","4","work in formal methodologies with computers, and most of them"
"1.4.3.1.8","5","are associated with activities that have to have computers"
"1.4.3.1.8","6","anyway, so that the new tech niques, concepts, methods, and"
"1.4.3.1.8","7","equipment will not seem so radical to them and will be"
"1.4.3.1.8","8","relatively easy for them to learn and acquire."
"1.4.3.1.9","1","9. Successful achievements can be utilized within the"
"1.4.3.1.9","2","augmentation-research program itself, to improve the"
"1.4.3.1.9","3","effectiveness of the computer programming activity involved in"
"1.4.3.1.9","4","studying and developing augmentation systems. The capability of"
"1.4.3.1.9","5","designing, implementing, and modifying computer programs will be"
"1.4.3.1.9","6","very important to the rate of research progress."
"1.4.3.2","1","Workers in an augmentation-research laboratory are the most"
"1.4.3.2","2","natural people in the world to be the very first users of the"
"1.4.3.2","3","augmentation means they develop, and we think that they"
"1.4.3.2","4","represent an extremely important group of people to make more"
"1.4.3.2","5","effective at their work."
"1.4.4","1","D. BASIC REGENERATIVE FEATURE"
"1.4.4.1","1","The feature brought forth in Reason 9 above is something that"
"1.4.4.1","2","offers tremendous value to the research objectives--i.e., the"
"1.4.4.1","3","feeding back of positive research results to improve the means"
"1.4.4.1","4","by which the researchers themselves can pursue their work The"
"1.4.4.1","5","plan we are describing here is designed to capitalize upon this"
"1.4.4.1","6","feature as much as possible, as will be evident to the reader as"
"1.4.4.1","7","he progresses through this section. This positive-feedback (or"
"1.4.4.1","8","regenerative) possibility derives from the facts that: (1) our"
"1.4.4.1","9","researchers are developing means to increase the effectiveness"
"1.4.4.1","10","of humans dealing with complex intellectual problems, and (2)"
"1.4.4.1","11","our researchers are dealing with complex intellectual problems."
"1.4.4.1","12","In other words, they are developing better tools for a class to"
"1.4.4.1","13","which they themselves belong. If their initial work needs the"
"1.4.4.1","14","unifying focus of concentrating upon a specific tool, let that"
"1.4.4.1","15","tool be one important to them and whose improvement will really"
"1.4.4.1","16","help their own work."
"1.4.5","1","E. TOOLS DEVELOPED AND TOOLS USED"
"1.4.5.1","1","This close similarity between tools being developed and the"
"1.4.5.1","2","tools being used to do the developing, calls for some care in"
"1.4.5.1","3","our terminology if we want to avoid confusion in our reasoning"
"1.4.5.1","4","about their relationship. &quot;Augmentation means&quot; will be"
"1.4.5.1","5","used to name the tools being developed by the augmentation"
"1.4.5.1","6","research. &quot;Subject Information&quot; will be used to refer"
"1.4.5.1","7","to description and reasoning concerned with the subject of these"
"1.4.5.1","8","tools (as opposed to the method of research), and &quot;subject"
"1.4.5.1","9","matter&quot; will refer to both subject information and physical"
"1.4.5.1","10","devices being incorporated as artifacts in the augmentation"
"1.4.5.1","11","means being developed. &quot;Tools and techniques&quot; will be"
"1.4.5.1","12","used to name the tools being used to do that research, and are"
"1.4.5.1","13","likely here to include special additions to language, artifact,"
"1.4.5.1","14","<i>and</i> methodology that particularly improve the special"
"1.4.5.1","15","capabilities exercised in doing the research."
"1.4.5.2","1","An integrated set of tools and techniques will represent an art"
"1.4.5.2","2","of doing augmentation research. Although no such art exists"
"1.4.5.2","3","ready-made for our use, there are many applicable or adaptable"
"1.4.5.2","4","tools and techniques to be borrowed from other disciplines."
"1.4.5.2","5","Psychology, computer programming and physical technology,"
"1.4.5.2","6","display technology, artificial intelligence, industrial"
"1.4.5.2","7","engineering (e.g., motion and time study), management science,"
"1.4.5.2","8","systems analysis, and information retrieval are some of the more"
"1.4.5.2","9","likely sources. These disciplines also offer initial subject"
"1.4.5.2","10","matter for the research. Because this kind of diagramming can"
"1.4.5.2","11","help more later on, we represent in Fig. 3 the situation of the"
"1.4.5.2","12","beginning research drawing upon existing disciplines for subject"
"1.4.5.2","13","matter and tools and techniques."
"1.4.5.3","1","The program begins with general dependence upon other, existing"
"1.4.5.3","2","disciplines for its subject matter (solid arrow) and its tools"
"1.4.5.3","3","and tech niques (dashed arrow). Goal 1 has been stated as that"
"1.4.5.3","4","of verifying the basic hypothesis that concerted augmentation"
"1.4.5.3","5","research can increase the intellectual effectiveness of human"
"1.4.5.3","6","problem solvers."

"1.4.5.3.1","2","/><br />Initial Augmentation-Research Program"
"1.4.6","1","F. RESEARCH PLAN FOR ACTIVITY A l"
"1.4.6.1","1","The dominant goal of Activity A 1 (Goal 1, as in Fig 3) is to"
"1.4.6.1","2","test our hypothesis. Its general pursuit of augmenting a"
"1.4.6.1","3","programmer is designed to serve this goal, but also to be"
"1.4.6.1","4","setting the stage for later direct pursuit of Goals 2 and 3"
"1.4.6.1","5","(i.e., developing tools and techniques for augmentation research"
"1.4.6.1","6","and producing real-world augmentation systems)."
"1.4.6.2","1","Before we discuss the possible subject matter through which this"
"1.4.6.2","2","research might work, let us treat the matter of its tools and"
"1.4.6.2","3","techniques. Not too long ago we would have recommended (and"
"1.4.6.2","4","did), in the spirit of taking the long-range and global"
"1.4.6.2","5","approach, that right from the beginning of a serious program of"
"1.4.6.2","6","this sort there should be established a careful and scientific"
"1.4.6.2","7","methodology. Controlled experiments, with special re search"
"1.4.6.2","8","subjects trained and tested in the use of experimental new aug"
"1.4.6.2","9","mentation means, careful monitoring, record-keeping, and"
"1.4.6.2","10","evaluative procedures, etc. This was to be accompanied by a"
"1.4.6.2","11","thorough search through disciplines and careful incorporation of"
"1.4.6.2","12","useful findings."
"1.4.6.3","1","Still in the spirit of the long-range and global sort of"
"1.4.6.3","2","planning, but with a different outlook (based, among other"
"1.4.6.3","3","things, upon an increased appreciation for the possibilities of"
"1.4.6.3","4","capitalizing upon regeneration), we would now recommend that the"
"1.4.6.3","5","approach be quite different. We basically recommend A 1 research"
"1.4.6.3","6","adhering to whatever formal methodology is required for (a)"
"1.4.6.3","7","knowing when an improvement in effectiveness has been achieved,"
"1.4.6.3","8","and (b) knowing how to assign <i>relative</i> value to the"
"1.4.6.3","9","changes derived from two competing innovations."
"1.4.6.4","1","Beyond this, and assuming dedication to the goal, reasonable"
"1.4.6.4","2","maturity, and plenty of energy, intelligence, and imagination,"
"1.4.6.4","3","we would recommend turning loose a group of four to six people"
"1.4.6.4","4","(or a number of such groups) to develop means that augment their"
"1.4.6.4","5","own programming capability We would recommend that their work"
"1.4.6.4","6","begin by developing the capability for composing and modifying"
"1.4.6.4","7","simple symbol structures, in the manner pictured in Section"
"1.4.6.4","8","III-B-2, and work up through a hierarchy of intermediate"
"1.4.6.4","9","capabilities toward the single high-level capability that would"
"1.4.6.4","10","encompass computer programming. This would allow their embryonic"
"1.4.6.4","11","and free wheeling &quot;art of doing augmentation research&quot;"
"1.4.6.4","12","to grow and work out its kinks through a succession of"
"1.4.6.4","13","increasingly complex system problems--and also, redesigning a"
"1.4.6.4","14","hierarchy from the bottom up somehow seems the best approach"
"1.4.6.5","1","As for the type of programming to tell them to become good at--"
"1.4.6.5","2","tell them, &quot;the kind that you find you have to do in your"
"1.4.6.5","3","research.&quot; In other words, their job assignment is to"
"1.4.6.5","4","develop means that will make them more effective at doing their"
"1.4.6.5","5","job. Figure 4 depicts this schematically, with the addition to"
"1.4.6.5","6","what was shown in Fig. 3 of a connection that feeds the subject-"

"1.4.6.6","1","If they are making head way, it won't take any carefully worded"
"1.4.6.6","2","criterion of effectiveness nor any great sophistication in"
"1.4.6.6","3","measurement technique to tell that they are more effective with"
"1.4.6.6","4","the augmentation means than without--being quicker to"
"1.4.6.6","5","&quot;design and build&quot; a running program to meet given"
"1.4.6.6","6","processing specifications or being quicker to pick up a complex"
"1.4.6.6","7","existing program, gain comprehension as necessary, and find its"
"1.4.6.6","8","flaws or rebuild it. On the other hand, if no gains are really"
"1.4.6.6","9","obvious after a year or so, then it is time to begin"
"1.4.6.6","10","incorporating more science in their approach.  By then there"
"1.4.6.6","11","will be a good deal of basic orientation as to the nature of the"
"1.4.6.6","12","problem to which &quot;science&quot; is to be applied."
"1.4.6.7","1","What we are recommending in a way is that the augmented"
"1.4.6.7","2","capability hierarchy built by this group represent more a quick"
"1.4.6.7","3","and rough scaffolding than a carefully engineered structure."
"1.4.6.7","4","There is orientation to be derived from climbing up quickly for"
"1.4.6.7","5","a look that will be of great value. For instance, key concepts"
"1.4.6.7","6","held initially, that would have been laboriously riveted into"
"1.4.6.7","7","the well-engineered structure, could well be rendered obsolete"
"1.4.6.7","8","by the &quot;view&quot; obtained from higher in the hierarchy."
"1.4.6.7","9","And besides, it seems best to get the quick and rough"
"1.4.6.7","10","improvements built and working first, so that the research will"
"1.4.6.7","11","benefit not only from the orientation obtained, but from the"
"1.4.6.7","12","help that these improvements will provide when used as tools and"
"1.4.6.7","13","techniques to tackle the tougher or slower possibilities. As"
"1.4.6.7","14","progress begins to be made toward Goal l,the diagram of Fig. 3"
"1.4.6.7","15","will become modified by feeding the subject-matter output"
"1.4.6.7","16","(augmentation means for computer programmers) back into the"
"1.4.6.7","17","input as new tools and techniques to be used by the researchers."
"1.4.6.8","1","We would suggest establishing a sub-activity within A 1, whose"
"1.4.6.8","2","purpose and responsibility is to keep an eye on the total"
"1.4.6.8","3","activity, assess and evaluate its progress and try to provide"
"1.4.6.8","4","orientation as to where things stand and where attention might"
"1.4.6.8","5","be beneficial."
"1.4.6.9","1","A few words about the subject matter through which Activity A 1"
"1.4.6.9","2","may progress. The researchers will think of simple innovations"
"1.4.6.9","3","and try them in short order--and perhaps be stimulated in the"
"1.4.6.9","4","process by realizing how handy some new feature would be that"
"1.4.6.9","5","would help them whlp up trlal processes in a hurry. They will"
"1.4.6.9","6","know of basic capabllitles they want to work toward for"
"1.4.6.9","7","structuring their argumentsJ their planning, their factual data,"
"1.4.6.9","8","etc., 50 that they can more easily get computer help in"
"1.4.6.9","9","developing themJ in analyzing and pursuing comprehension within"
"1.4.6.9","10","themJ and in modifying or extending them. They wlll try"
"1.4.6.9","11","different types of structuringJ and see how easy it ls to design"
"1.4.6.9","12","computer processes to manipulate them or composite processes to"
"1.4.6.9","13","do total useful work with them."
"1.4.6.10","1","They can work up programs that can search through other programs"
"1.4.6.10","2","for answers to questions about them--questions whose answers"
"1.4.6.10","3","serve the processes of debugging, extending, or modifying."
"1.4.6.10","4","Perhaps there will be ways they adopt in the initial structuring"
"1.4.6.10","5","of a program--e.g., appending stylized descriptive cues here and"
"1.4.6.10","6","there--that have no function in the execution of that program,"
"1.4.6.10","7","but which allow more sophisticated fact retrieval therein by the"
"1.4.6.10","8","computer. Perhaps such cue tagging would allow development of"
"1.4.6.10","9","programs which could automatically make fairly sophisticated"
"1.4.6.10","10","modifications to a tagged program. Maybe there would evolve"
"1.4.6.10","11","semi-automatic &quot;super-compilers,&quot; with which the"
"1.4.6.10","12","programmer and the computer leap-frog over the obstacles to"
"1.4.6.10","13","formulating exact specifications for a computer (or perhaps"
"1.4.6.10","14","composlte) process and getting it into whatever programming"
"1.4.6.10","15","language they use."
"1.4.7","1","G. A SECOND PHASE IN THE RESEARCH PROGRAM"
"1.4.7.1","1","The research of A 1 could probably spiral upwards indefinitely,"
"1.4.7.1","2","but once the hypothesis (see Section IV-A) has been reasonably"
"1.4.7.1","3","verified and the first of our stated objectives satisfied, it"
"1.4.7.1","4","would be best to re-organize the program. To describe our"
"1.4.7.1","5","recommendation here, let us say that two research activies, A 2"
"1.4.7.1","6","and A 3, are set up in place of A 1. Whether A 1 is split, or"
"1.4.7.1","7","turned into A 2 and a new group formed for A 3, does not really"
"1.4.7.1","8","matter here--we are speaking of separate activities,"
"1.4.7.1","9","corresponding to the responsible pursuit of separate goals, that"
"1.4.7.1","10","will benefit from close cooperation."
"1.4.7.2","1","To Activity A 2 assign the job of developing augmentation means"
"1.4.7.2","2","to be used specifically as tools and techniques by the"
"1.4.7.2","3","researchers of both A 2 and A 3. This establishes a continuing"
"1.4.7.2","4","pursuit for Objective 2 of Section IY-A. A 2 will now set up a"
"1.4.7.2","5","sub-activity that studies the problems of all the workers in A 2"
"1.4.7.2","6","and A 3 and isolates a succession of capabilities for which the"
"1.4.7.2","7","research of A 2 will develop means to augment. Activity A 2"
"1.4.7.2","8","should be equipped with the best artifacts available to an"
"1.4.7.2","9","experimental laboratory."
"1.4.7.3","1","To Activity A 3 assign the job of developing augmentation"
"1.4.7.3","2","systems that can be practically adopted into real-world problem"
"1.4.7.3","3","situations. This provides a direct and continuing pursuit of"
"1.4.7.3","4","Goal 3 of Section IV-A. It is to be assumed that the first real-"
"1.4.7.3","5","world system that A 3 will design will be for computer"
"1.4.7.3","6","programmers. For this it might well be able to clean up the"
"1.4.7.3","7","&quot;laboratory model&quot; developed in A 1, modify it to fit"
"1.4.7.3","8","the practical limitations represented by real-world economics,"
"1.4.7.3","9","working environments, etc., and offer it as a prototype for"
"1.4.7.3","10","practical adoption. Or Activity A 3 might do a redesign,"
"1.4.7.3","11","benefitting from the experience with the first model."
"1.4.7.4","1","Activity A 3 will need a subactivity to study its potential"
"1.4.7.4","2","users and guide the succession of developments that it pursues."
"1.4.7.4","3","Activity A 2 in its continued pursuit of increased effectiveness"
"1.4.7.4","4","among workers in idealized environment, will be the source for"
"1.4.7.4","5","basic subject matter in the developments of A 3, as well as for"
"1.4.7.4","6","its tools and techniques. From the continously expanding"
"1.4.7.4","7","knowledge and developments of A 2, A 3 can organize successive"
"1.4.7.4","8","practical systems suitable for ever more general utilization."
"1.4.7.5","1","We have assumed that what was developed in A 1 was primarily"
"1.4.7.5","2","language and methodology, with the artifacts not being subject"
"1.4.7.5","3","to appreciable modification during the research. By this second"
"1.4.7.5","4","phase, enough has been learned about the trends and"
"1.4.7.5","5","possibilities for this type of on-line man-computer cooperation"
"1.4.7.5","6","that some well-based guidance can be derived for the types of"
"1.4.7.5","7","modifications and extensions to artifact capability that would"
"1.4.7.5","8","be most valuable. Activity A 2 could continue to derive long-"
"1.4.7.5","9","range guidance for equipment development, perhaps developing"
"1.4.7.5","10","laboratory innovations in computers, display systems, storage"
"1.4.7.5","11","systems, or communication systems, but at least experimenting"
"1.4.7.5","12","with the incorporation of the new artifact innovations of"
"1.4.7.5","13","others."
"1.4.7.6","1","An example of the type of guidance derived from this research"
"1.4.7.6","2","might be extracted from the concepts discussed in Section-C-5"
"1.4.7.6","3","(Structure Types).  We point out there that within the computer"
"1.4.7.6","4","there might be built and manipulated symbol structures that"
"1.4.7.6","5","represent better images of the concept structures of interest to"
"1.4.7.6","6","the human than would any symbol structure with which the human"
"1.4.7.6","7","could work directly. To the human, the computer represents a"
"1.4.7.6","8","special instrument which can display to him a comprehensible"
"1.4.7.6","9","image of any characteristic of this structure that may be of"
"1.4.7.6","10","interest. From our conceptual viewpoint, this would be a source"
"1.4.7.6","11","of tremendous power for the human to harness, but it depends"
"1.4.7.6","12","upon the computer being able to &quot;read&quot; all of the"
"1.4.7.6","13","stored information (which would be in a form essentially"
"1.4.7.6","14","incomprehensible to a human). Now, if this conjecture is borne"
"1.4.7.6","15","out there would be considerably less value in micro-image"
"1.4.7.6","16","information-storage systems than is now generally presumed. In"
"1.4.7.6","17","other words, we now conjecture that future reference information"
"1.4.7.6","18","will be much more valuable if stored in computer-sensible form."
"1.4.7.6","19","The validity of this and other conjectures stemming from our"
"1.4.7.6","20","conceptual framework could represent critical questions to"
"1.4.7.6","21","manufacturers of information systems."
"1.4.7.7","1","It is obvious that this report stems from generalized"
"1.4.7.7","2","&quot;large-view&quot; thinking. To carry this to something of a"
"1.4.7.7","3","final view, relative to the research recommendations, we present"
"1.4.7.7","4","Fig. 5, which should be largely self-explanatory by this time."
"1.4.7.7","5","Activity A 2 is lifting itself by the bootstraps up the scale of"
"1.4.7.7","6","intellectual capability, and its products are siphoned to the"
"1.4.7.7","7","world via A 3. Getting acceptance and application of the new"
"1.4.7.7","8","techniques to the most critical problems of our society might in"
"1.4.7.7","9","fact <i>be</i> the most critical problem of all by then, and"
"1.4.7.7","10","Activity A 4 would be one which should be given special help"
"1.4.7.7","11","from A 3."
"1.4.7.8","1","There is another general and long-range picture to present. This"
"1.4.7.8","2","is in regard to a goal for a practically usable system that A 3"
"1.4.7.8","3","would want to develop as soon as possible. You might call this"
"1.4.7.8","4","the first general Computer Augmentation System--CAUG-I"
"1.4.7.8","5","(pronounced &quot;cog-one&quot;)."

"1.4.7.9","1","It would be derived from what was assessed to be the basic set"
"1.4.7.9","2","of capabilities needed by both a general-problem-solvlng human"
"1.4.7.9","3","and an augmentation researcher. Give CAUG-I to a real-world"
"1.4.7.9","4","problem solver in almost any discipline, and he has the basic"
"1.4.7.9","5","capabilities for structuring his arguments and plans, organizing"
"1.4.7.9","6","special files, etc., that almost anyone could expect to need."
"1.4.7.9","7","In addition to these direct-application on capabilities,"
"1.4.7.9","8","however, are provided those capabilities necessary for analyzing"
"1.4.7.9","9","problem tasks, developing and evaluating new process"

"1.4.7.9","11","CAUG-I system to match to the special features of his problem"

"1.4.7.10","1","In other words, CAUG-I represents a basic problem-solving tool"
"1.4.7.10","2","kit, plus an auxiliary tool-makers tool kit with which to extend"
"1.4.7.10","3","the basic tool kit to match the particular job and particular"

"1.4.7.10","8","basic capabilities of the human."
"1.5","1","V. SUMMARY"
"1.5.1","1","This report has treated one over-all view of the augmentation of"
"1.5.1","2","human intellect. In the report the following things have been"
"1.5.1","3","done: (1) An hypothesis has been presented. (2) A conceptual"
"1.5.1","4","framework has been constructed. (3) A &quot;picture&quot; of"
"1.5.1","5","augmented man has been described. (4) A research approach has"
"1.5.1","6","been outlined. These aspects will be re viewed here briefly:"
"1.5.1.1","1","1. An hypothesis has been stated that the intellectual"
"1.5.1.1","2","effectiveness of a human can be significantly improved by an"
"1.5.1.1","3","engineering-like approach toward redesigning changeable"
"1.5.1.1","4","components of a system."
"1.5.1.2","1","2. A conceptual framework has been constructed that helps"
"1.5.1.2","2","provide a way of looking at the implications and possibilities"
"1.5.1.2","3","surrounding and stemming from this hypothesis. Briefly, this"
"1.5.1.2","4","framework provides the realization that our intellects are"
"1.5.1.2","5","already augmented by means which appear to have the following"
"1.5.1.2","6","characteristics:"
"1.5.1.2.1","1","A. The principal elements are the language artifacts, and"
"1.5.1.2.1","2","methodology that a human has learned to use."
"1.5.1.2.2","1","B. The elements are dynamically interdependent within an"
"1.5.1.2.2","2","operating system."
"1.5.1.2.3","1","C. The structure of the system seems to be hierarchical, and to"
"1.5.1.2.3","2","be best considered as a hierarchy of process capabilities whose"
"1.5.1.2.3","3","primitive components are the basic human capabilities and the"
"1.5.1.2.3","4","functional capabilities of the artifacts--which are organized"
"1.5.1.2.3","5","successively into ever-more-sophisticated capabilities."
"1.5.1.2.4","1","D. The capabilities of prime interest are those associated with"
"1.5.1.2.4","2","manipulating symbols and concepts in support of organizing and"
"1.5.1.2.4","3","executing processes from which are ultimately derived human"
"1.5.1.2.4","4","comprehension and problem solutions."
"1.5.1.2.5","1","E. The automation of the symbol manipulation associated with the"
"1.5.1.2.5","2","minute-by-minute mental processes seems to offer a logical next"
"1.5.1.2.5","3","step in the evolution of our intellectual capability."
"1.5.1.3","1","3. A picture of the implications and promise of this framework"
"1.5.1.3","2","has been described, based upon direct human communication with a"
"1.5.1.3","3","computer. Here the many ways in which the computer could be of"
"1.5.1.3","4","service, at successive levels of augmented capability, have been"
"1.5.1.3","5","brought out. This picture is fanciful, but we believe it to be"
"1.5.1.3","6","conservative and representative of the sort of rich and"
"1.5.1.3","7","significant gains that are there to be pursued."
"1.5.1.4","1","4. An approach has been outlined for testing the hypothesis of"
"1.5.1.4","2","Item (1) and for pursuing the &quot;rich and significant"
"1.5.1.4","3","gains&quot; which we feel are promised. This approach is"
"1.5.1.4","4","designed to treat the redesign of a capability hierarchy by"
"1.5.1.4","5","reworking from the bottom up, and yet to make the research on"
"1.5.1.4","6","augmentation means progress as fast as possible by deriving"
"1.5.1.4","7","practically usable augmentation systems for real-world problem"
"1.5.1.4","8","solvers at a maximum rate. This goal is fostered by the"
"1.5.1.4","9","recommendation of incorporating positive feedback into the"
"1.5.1.4","10","research development--i.e., concentrating a good share of the"
"1.5.1.4","11","basic-research attention upon augmenting those capabilities in a"
"1.5.1.4","12","human that are needed in the augmentation-research workers. The"
"1.5.1.4","13","real-world applications would be pursued by designing a"
"1.5.1.4","14","succession of systems for specialists, whose progression"
"1.5.1.4","15","corresponds to the increasing generality of the capabilities for"
"1.5.1.4","16","which coordinated augmentation means have been evolved."
"1.5.1.4","17","Consideration is given in this rather global approach to"
"1.5.1.4","18","providing potential users in different domains of intellectual"
"1.5.1.4","19","activity with the basic general-purpose augmentation system from"
"1.5.1.4","20","which they themselves can construct the special featuresof a"
"1.5.1.4","21","system to match their job, and their ways of working--or it"
"1.5.1.4","22","could be used on the other hand by researchers who want to"
"1.5.1.4","23","pursue the development of sepcial augmentation systems for"
"1.5.1.4","24","special fields."
"1.6","1","VI. CONCLUSIONS"
"1.6.1","1","Three principal conclusions may be drawn concerning the"
"1.6.1","2","significance and implications of the ideas that have been"
"1.6.1","3","presented."
"1.6.2","1","First any possibility for improving the effective utilization of"
"1.6.2","2","the intellectual power of society's problem solvers warrants the"
"1.6.2","3","most serious consideration. This is because man's problem-"
"1.6.2","4","solving capability represents possibly the most important"
"1.6.2","5","resource possessed by a society. The other contenders for first"
"1.6.2","6","importance are all critically dependent for their development"
"1.6.2","7","and use upon this resource. Any possibility for evolving an art"
"1.6.2","8","or science that can couple directly and significantly to the"
"1.6.2","9","continued development of that resource should warrant doubly"
"1.6.2","10","serious consideration."
"1.6.3","1","Second, the ideas presented are to be considered in both of the"
"1.6.3","2","above senses: the direct-development sense and the 'art of"
"1.6.3","3","development' sense.  To be sure, the possibilities have long-"
"1.6.3","4","term implications, but their pursuit and initial rewards await"
"1.6.3","5","us now. By our view, we <i>do not</i> have to wait until we"
"1.6.3","6","learn how the human mental processes work, we <i>do not</i> have"
"1.6.3","7","to wait until we learn how to make computers more intelligent or"
"1.6.3","8","bigger or faster, <i>we can</i> begin developing powerful and"
"1.6.3","9","economically feasible augmentation systems on the basis of what"
"1.6.3","10","we now know and have. Pursuit of further basic knowledge and"
"1.6.3","11","improved machines will continue into the unlimited future, and"
"1.6.3","12","will want to be integrated into the &quot;art&quot; and its"
"1.6.3","13","improved augmentation systems--but getting started now will"
"1.6.3","14","provide not only orientation and stimulation for these pursuits,"
"1.6.3","15","but will give us improved problem-solving effectiveness with"
"1.6.3","16","which to carry out the pursuits."
"1.6.4","1","Third, it becomes increasingly clear that there should be action"
"1.6.4","2","now--the sooner the better--action in a number of research"
"1.6.4","3","communities and on an aggressive scale. We offer a conceptual"
"1.6.4","4","framework and a plan for action, and we recommend that these be"
"1.6.4","5","considered carefully as a basis for action If they be considered"
"1.6.4","6","but found unacceptable, then at least serious and continued"
"1.6.4","7","effort should be made toward developing a more acceptable"
"1.6.4","8","conceptual framework within which to view the over-all approach,"
"1.6.4","9","toward developing a more acceptable plan of action, or both."
"1.6.5","1","This is an open plea to researchers and to those who ultimately"
"1.6.5","2","motivate, finance, or direct them, to turn serious attention"
"1.6.5","3","toward the possibility of evolving a dynamic discipline that"
"1.6.5","4","can-treat the problem of improving intellectual effectiveness in"
"1.6.5","5","a total sense. This discipline should aim at producing a"
"1.6.5","6","continuous cycle of improvements--increased understanding of the"
"1.6.5","7","problem, improved means for developing new aug mentation"
"1.6.5","8","systems, and improved augmentation systems that can serve the"
"1.6.5","9","world's problem solvers in general and this discipline's workers"
"1.6.5","10","in particular. After all, we spend great sums for disciplines"
"1.6.5","11","aimed at understanding and harnessing nuclear power. Why not"
"1.6.5","12","consider developing a discipline aimed at understanding and"
"1.6.5","13","harnessing &quot;neural power?&quot; In the long run, the power"
"1.6.5","14","of the human intellect is really much the more important of the"
"1.6.5","15","two."
