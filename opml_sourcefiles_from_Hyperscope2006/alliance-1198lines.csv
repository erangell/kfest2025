"1.2.1","1","Our world is a complex place with urgent problems of a global"
"1.2.1","2","scale."
"1.2.2","1","The rate, scale, and complex nature of change is unprecedented"
"1.2.2","2","and beyond the capability of any one person, organization, or"
"1.2.2","3","even nation to comprehend and respond to."
"1.2.3","1","Challenges of an exponential scale require an evolutionary"
"1.2.3","2","coping strategy of a commensurate scale on a cooperative cross-"
"1.2.3","3","disciplinary, international, cross-cultural level."
"1.2.4","1","We need a new, co-evolutionary environment capable of handling"
"1.2.4","2","simultaneous complex social, technical, and economic changes at"
"1.2.4","3","an appropriate rate and scale."
"1.2.5","1","The grand challenge is to boost the Collective IQ of"
"1.2.5","2","organizations and of society; success of this effort will"
"1.2.5","3","improve the capacity to address any other grand challenge."
"1.2.6","1","The improvements gained and applied in its own pursuit will"
"1.2.6","2","accelerate the improvement of Collective IQ. This is a"
"1.2.6","3","bootstrapping strategy."
"1.2.7","1","Those organizations, communities, institutions and nations that"
"1.2.7","2","successfully bootstrap their Collective IQ will achieve the"
"1.2.7","3","highest levels of performance and success."
