"1.1","1","INTRODUCTION"
"1.1.1","1","Welcome to the AUGMENT Browser!  This file is a sort of"
"1.1.1","2","&quot;programmed text&quot; for new users.  By following the"
"1.1.1","3","instructions contained in it, you should be able to learn by"
"1.1.1","4","yourself how to use many of the unique and powerful features of"
"1.1.1","5","this system.  In this lesson you will learn the basics of"
"1.1.1","6","browsing AUGMENT files."
"1.1.2","1","Don't worry if you make a mistake -- you can't hurt anything."
"1.2","1","AUGMENTED BROWSING"
"1.2.1","1","The AUGMENT Browser provides some of the power and efficiency of"
"1.2.1","2","AUGMENT in a simple, easy-to-use format which looks and feels"
"1.2.1","3","pretty much like the browsers you normally use. The simplest"
"1.2.1","4","form of the AUGMENT Browser, &quot;User Class 1&quot;, offers"
"1.2.1","5","these value-added features:"
"1.2.1.1","1","* Zoom  buttons for zooming in and out of structure"
"1.2.1.2","1","* unified access into a &quot;living&quot; repository of"
"1.2.1.2","2","documents, email   and other dialog records, intelligence"
"1.2.1.2","3","collections, briefings,   source code, workflow, etc."
"1.2.1.3","1","* automatic numbering of each object for easy reference"
"1.2.1.4","1","* use of the numbers and custom view settings inside URL links"
"1.2.2","1","Let's begin with zooming."
"1.3","1","ZOOMING"
"1.3.1","1","Most files in a knowledge repository have a logical structure,"
"1.3.1","2","be it a document, email, meeting records, source code, work"
"1.3.1","3","breakdown, briefings, or time logs. For example, this tutor file"
"1.3.1","4","is structured with the headings, paragraphs, and lists. AUGMENT"
"1.3.1","5","actually uses this structure for rapid and efficient browsing."
"1.3.1","6","Using the Zoom buttons provided in the left margin, you can"
"1.3.1","7","quickly zoom in and out of the structure for less or more detail"
"1.3.1","8","on a particular topic:"
"1.3.1.1","1","FULL VIEW:   The rightmost button provides a &quot;normal&quot;"
"1.3.1.1","2","view, or                        &quot;full&quot; view (the same"
"1.3.1.1","3","view you have now)."
"1.3.1.2","1","ZOOM OUT:  The leftmost button zooms OUT to an outline view."
"1.3.1.3","1","ZOOM IN:     The middle button zooms IN for a more detailed"
"1.3.1.3","2","outline view."
"1.3.1.4","1","Note that all three buttons will hoist, or &quot;Jump&quot; the"
"1.3.1.4","2","associated heading or paragraph to the top of the viewing"
"1.3.1.4","3","window."
"1.3.2","1","Now try it."
"1.3.2.1","1","=> Zooming Instructions:"

"1.3.2.1.1","4","finished."
"1.4","1","KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES"
"1.4.1","1","A knowledge repository is typically a collection of knowledge,"
"1.4.1","2","such as a web site, news group, online conference, or digital"
"1.4.1","3","library.  The largest repository on the AUGMENT host is the"
"1.4.1","4","AUGMENT reference library -- the published documents about"
"1.4.1","5","AUGMENT, what it does, and how to use it.  The homepage for this"
"1.4.1","6","repository is the AUGMENT Locator.  This will be the destination"
"1.4.1","7","for your next exercise. Feel free to follow any links that you"
"1.4.1","8","find."
"1.4.1.1","1","Also feel free to request &quot;Bookmarks&quot;, which will"
"1.4.1.1","2","create an editable index for you in an AUGMENT file (later you"
"1.4.1.1","3","will learn how to annotate and otherwise manage your bookmarks)."
"1.4.2","1","=> Browsing Exercise Instructions:"
"1.4.2.1","1","1)  First, note where you are now so you can find your way"

"1.5.1","1","The browser you are using is part of a suite of tools designed"
"1.5.1","2","specifically to boost &quot;Collective IQ&quot; of teams,"
"1.5.1","3","organizations, and communities.  &quot;Collective IQ&quot; is a"
"1.5.1","4","measure of how quickly and intelligently people can work"
"1.5.1","5","collectively toward common goals. This goes well beyond getting"
"1.5.1","6","more information faster, to include leveraging their collective"
"1.5.1","7","memory, perception, foresight, planning, problem-solving, and so"
"1.5.1","8","on, into applicable knowledge.  This knowledge goes well beyond"
"1.5.1","9","the published documents, to include successive drafts,"
"1.5.1","10","commentary, dialog records, rationale, intelligence collections,"
"1.5.1","11","and so forth."
"1.5.2","1","This system was designed to facilitate"
"1.5.2.1","1","* the collaborative process"
"1.5.2.2","1","* the unified development, capture, integration, management,"
"1.5.2.2","2","cross-referencing, and tracking of heterogeneous knowledge"
"1.5.2.3","1","* value-added utilization of this knowledge"
"1.5.3","1","So instead of an archive of publications, a &quot;living&quot;"
"1.5.3","2","knowledge repository should be a dynamic work environment, and a"
"1.5.3","3","vehicle for collaboration across time, space, and organizational"
"1.5.3","4","boundaries."
"1.5.4","1","Following are some examples of living repositories for you to"
"1.5.4","2","browse. Each link will start you off with an outline view of a"
"1.5.4","3","Locator file.  Again, feel free to request Bookmarks, and to"
"1.5.4","4","follow any links that you find.  For example, you may come"
"1.5.4","5","across a status report containing references to bug fixes, which"
"1.5.4","6","may in turn reference the corresponding source code, which in"
"1.5.4","7","turn references the design documents."
