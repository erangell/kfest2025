"1","26","(AUGMENT,133171,).DotSplit;"
"1.1","1","Douglas Carl Engelbart has a thirty-year track record in"
"1.1","2","predicting, designing, and implementing the future of"
"1.1","3","organizational computing."
"1.2","1","The grandson of early pioneers of the West, he grew up during"
"1.2","2","the Great Depression on a small farmstead near Portland, Oregon."
"1.2","3","After graduating from high school in 1942, he went on to study"
"1.2","4","Electrical Engineering at Oregon State University. His studies"
"1.2","5","were interrupted when he joined the Navy during World War II,"
"1.2","6","and served for two years as an electronic/radar technician in"
"1.2","7","the Phillipines."
"1.3","1","After completing his Bachelors Degree in E.E. in 1948, he"
"1.3","2","settled contentedly on the San Francisco peninsula as an"
"1.3","3","electrical engineer at NACA Ames Laboratory (forerunner of"
"1.3","4","NASA)."
"1.4","1","However, within three years he grew restless, feeling there was"
"1.4","2","something more important he should be working on, dedicating his"
"1.4","3","career to. He thought about the world's problems, and what he as"
"1.4","4","an engineer might possibly be able to do about them. He had read"
"1.4","5","about the development of the computer, and seriously considered"
"1.4","6","how it might be used to support mankind's efforts to solve these"
"1.4","7","problems. As a radar technician he had seen how information"
"1.4","8","could be displayed on a tube. He began to envision people"
"1.4","9","sitting in front of displays, &quot;flying around&quot; in an"
"1.4","10","information space where they could formulate and organize their"
"1.4","11","ideas with incredible speed and flexibility. So he applied to"
"1.4","12","the graduate program in Electrical Engineering at U.C. Berkeley"
"1.4","13","to launch his new crusade (at that time there was no computer"
"1.4","14","science department, and the closest working computer was in"
"1.4","15","Maryland)."
"1.5","1","He earned his Ph.D. in 1955, along with a half dozen patents in"
"1.5","2","&quot;bi-stable gaseous plasma digital devices&quot;, and then"
"1.5","3","stayed on as Acting Assistant Professor. However, within a year"
"1.5","4","he was tipped off by a colleague that if he kept talking about"
"1.5","5","his &quot;wild ideas&quot; he'd be an Acting Assistant Professor"
"1.5","6","forever. So he ventured back down the Peninsula in search of a"
"1.5","7","more suitable outpost."
"1.6","1","He settled on a research position at SRI (then Stanford Research"
"1.6","2","Institute), where he earned another dozen patents in two years"
"1.6","3","working on magnetic computer components, fundamental digital-"
"1.6","4","device phenomena, and miniaturization scaling potential."
"1.7","1","By 1959 he had enough standing to get approval to pursue his own"
"1.7","2","research. He spent the next two years formulating a theoretical"
"1.7","3","framework for a new discipline, which became the guiding force"
"1.7","4","for his seminal work (see Paper #2)."
"1.8","1","This framework is based on the assumptions that complexity and"
"1.8","2","urgency are increasing exponentially, and that the product of"
"1.8","3","the two will soon challenge our organizations and institutions"
"1.8","4","to change in quantum leaps rather than incremental steps."
"1.8","5","Therefore, in addition to aspiring to be increasingly faster and"
"1.8","6","smarter at their core missions (whether creating better widgets,"
"1.8","7","or solving societal problems), organizations will have to get"
"1.8","8","increasingly faster and smarter at how they keep improving."
"1.8","9","Engelbart saw both organizational missions as relying on the"
"1.8","10","same core capabilities, which he encapsulated in the term human"
"1.8","11","intellect (later switching to Drucker's knowledge work)."
"1.9","1","This thinking prompted an analysis of what capabilities humans"
"1.9","2","draw from, aside from what they are born with, to boost their"
"1.9","3","intellect. A myriad of technical and non-technical elements"
"1.9","4","emerged, such as tools, media, language, customs, knowledge,"
"1.9","5","skills, procedures, and so on. He recognized that these elements"
"1.9","6","had co-evolved slowly over centuries, but with the advent of"
"1.9","7","digital technology, the technical elements would shoot way ahead"
"1.9","8","of the non-technical, and tend to automate rather than augment"
"1.9","9","human intellect. What would be needed would be to engineer all"
"1.9","10","the elements in an accelerating co-evolutionary process, setting"
"1.9","11","up advanced pilot &quot;outposts&quot; in which to experiment"
"1.9","12","and explore future work modes. He further surmised that an early"
"1.9","13","target for application should be to support improvement"
"1.9","14","activities, especially the designers, implementers, and"
"1.9","15","deployers of these tools and practices (the essence of"
"1.9","16","bootstrapping)."
"1.10","1","Then in 1963 he finally got the funds to start his own research"
"1.10","2","lab, which he later dubbed the Augmentation Research Center. He"
"1.10","3","began by developing the kind of technology he believed would be"
"1.10","4","required to augment our human intellect, and also to support the"
"1.10","5","bootstrapping/augmentation process. Throughout the '60s and '70s"
"1.10","6","his lab pioneered an elaborate hypermedia-groupware system"
"1.10","7","called NLS (for oNLine System), most of whose now-common"
"1.10","8","features were conceived of, fully integrated, and in everyday"
"1.10","9","operational use, by the early 1970s (see Pioneering Firsts,"
"1.10","10","center panel)."
"1.11","1","In the spring of 1967, it was announced that all the ARPA-"
"1.11","2","sponsored computer research labs, including Engelbart's, would"
"1.11","3","be networked to promote resource sharing. Engelbart was"
"1.11","4","thrilled. He saw the ARPANET as an excellent vehicle for"
"1.11","5","extending NLS provisions for wide-area distributed"
"1.11","6","collaboration. He also saw NLS as a natural to support an online"
"1.11","7","directory of resources, so he proposed a Network Information"
"1.11","8","Center (NIC), which he built up and directed until around 1977,"
"1.11","9","when it spun off as an independent operation. Because of this"
"1.11","10","early active role in the formation of the ARPANET community, his"
"1.11","11","site was the second host on the network."
"1.12","1","NLS was first demonstrated in public at the 1968 Fall Joint"
"1.12","2","Computer Conference in a remarkable 90-minute multimedia"
"1.12","3","presentation, in which Engelbart  used NLS to outline and"
"1.12","4","illustrate his points, while others of his staff linked in from"
"1.12","5","his lab at SRI to demonstrate key features of the system. This"
"1.12","6","was the world debut of the mouse, hypermedia, and on-screen"
"1.12","7","video teleconferencing (see Paper #5 and companion video;"
"1.12","8","selected footage is also on display at the Smithsonian Museum"
"1.12","9","Exhibit on The Information Age)."
"1.13","1","In keeping with his Augmentation framework, Engelbart"
"1.13","2","incorporated psychology and organizational development into his"
"1.13","3","research. He also believed very strongly that the human-tool co-"
"1.13","4","evolution should be based on rigorous exploratory use in a wide"
"1.13","5","variety of real-world applications (see Paper #25). So in the"
"1.13","6","mid-'70s he began building a community of users via the ARPANET"
"1.13","7","and sponsored user group meetings of &quot;Knowledge Work"
"1.13","8","Architects&quot; to collaborate on pilot trials and future"
"1.13","9","requirements."
"1.14","1","In keeping with his Bootstrapping strategy, he employed NLS from"
"1.14","2","the beginning for distributed collaborative software"
"1.14","3","engineering, technology transfer, and community support (see"
"1.14","4","Papers #7, #9, and #17).  For example, his Knowledge Work"
"1.14","5","Architects Community was supported by NLS, as was his entire"
"1.14","6","R&amp;D operation-NLS was developed and maintained using NLS in"
"1.14","7","structured hypertext files, with links between the source code,"
"1.14","8","design documents, specifications, bug reports, change requests,"
"1.14","9","thinkpieces, commentary, rationale, customer records, etc."
"1.14.1","1","At its peak his SRI lab had grown to 47 people, inluding the"
"1.14.1","2","NIC. (For a more detailed autobiographical sketch of his"
"1.14.1","3","&quot;odyssey&quot; since 1951, see Paper #23 and companion"
"1.14.1","4","video)."
"1.15","1","In 1977 Tymshare bought the commercial rights to NLS, renamed it"
"1.15","2","AUGMENT, and set it up as a principal line of business in a"
"1.15","3","newly formed Office Automation Division. There the focus"
"1.15","4","switched from R&amp;D to commercialization, and in spite of"
"1.15","5","Engelbart's efforts, the human/organizational work was cut off,"
"1.15","6","including his carefully cultivated user group. In 1984 Tymshare"
"1.15","7","was acquired by McDonnell Douglas Corporation, where Engelbart"
"1.15","8","began working closely with the aerospace components on issues of"
"1.15","9","integrated information system architectures and associated"
"1.15","10","evolutionary strategies (a welcome extension of his work at"
"1.15","11","SRI)."
"1.16","1","In the last decade, thousands of knowledge workers in industry"
"1.16","2","and government have benefited from the unique team support"
"1.16","3","capabilities of NLS and its evolutionary successor AUGMENT. In"
"1.16","4","recent years there has been a surge of interest and exploration"
"1.16","5","in the new interrelated topics of Computer-Supported Cooperative"
"1.16","6","Work, groupware, and hypermedia. It is now recognized that"
"1.16","7","Engelbart's emphasis at SRI on supporting collaborative work,"
"1.16","8","and the breadth of associated system development, not only"
"1.16","9","clearly anticipated this major trend, but produced in"
"1.16","10","NLS/AUGMENT what is still the most comprehensive system for"
"1.16","11","supporting wide-area collaboration (see Papers #24, #21, and"
"1.16","12","#22.)"
"1.17","1","Engelbart's work has never been easy. Through the years he has"
"1.17","2","been misunderstood, told he was &quot;dead wrong&quot;,"
"1.17","3","ridiculed, or simply ignored, which many say is to be expected"
"1.17","4","when one is &quot;20 years ahead of his time&quot;. As each new"
"1.17","5","wave of the computer revolution unfolds (e.g. office automation,"
"1.17","6","personal computing, groupware, hypertext), and people's"
"1.17","7","experience become more aligned with Engelbart's vision, they"
"1.17","8","typically say &quot;OK, now I see what he was trying to"
"1.17","9","do&quot;. However, they are still looking at bits of his past,"
"1.17","10","while he continues to point into the future ..."
"1.18","1","In recent years, Engelbart has been heartened by the movements"
"1.18","2","in total quality, business process reengineering, reinventing"
"1.18","3","organizations, concurrent engineering, groupware, hypermedia,"
"1.18","4","the World Wide Web, and all the impressive networks of"
"1.18","5","improvement activities sprouting up all over the world. He is"
"1.18","6","hopeful that enough synergy can be generated among these"
"1.18","7","activities to ignite a serious, thriving bootstrapping"
"1.18","8","activity-a collaborative improvement community aimed at spawning"
"1.18","9","those quantum leap improvements in our organizations, boosting"
"1.18","10","our &quot;collective IQ&quot; to unforeseen heights. This"
"1.18","11","bootstrapping community would jointly pioneer future work modes,"
"1.18","12","enabled by advanced, rapidly evolving prototypes, and pioneer"
"1.18","13","better and better strategies for designing, implementing, and"
"1.18","14","transferring those work modes into common practice. The"
"1.18","15","community would act as a rigorous beta site of its R&amp;D"
"1.18","16","results, a staging area for implementing and evaluating pilot"
"1.18","17","trials, and an industry focus for anticipating requirements and"
"1.18","18","the much needed industry standards in this arena (see Papers #26"
"1.18","19","and #29)."
"1.19","1","In 1989 Engelbart founded the Bootstrap Institute, feeling the"
"1.19","2","time was ripe to pursue in earnest his comprehensive strategy"
"1.19","3","for bootstrapping organizations into the 21st century. His focus"
"1.19","4","continues to be in creating high-performance organizations by"
"1.19","5","fostering bootstrapping communities, researching and developing"
"1.19","6","the enabling technologies, best practices, and special"
"1.19","7","strategies for developing and deploying these capabilities on a"
"1.19","8","continuous improvement basis, with pro-active participation from"
"1.19","9","stakeholders in government, industry, and society (see Papers"
"1.19","10","#27-#29). Engelbart divides his time between R&amp;D,"
"1.19","11","consulting, publications, speaking engagements, and leading"
"1.19","12","seminars, workshops, and participatory &quot;expeditions&quot;."
"1.20","1","Doug Engelbart has authored over 25 publications, and generated"
